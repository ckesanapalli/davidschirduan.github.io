Part 3 of my workshop series to improve Bone Marshes continues! 

[Part 1](/david/2018/12/BoneMarshesWorkshop), [Part 2](/david/2018/12/BoneMarshesWorkshop2) here.

This is a fantastic series from The Alexandrian on [Jaquaying the Dungeon](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon).

I'll try to sum up some of the key points here, and how we can apply them to The Bone Marshes.

## Dungeon Diagrams

One things I really like is how Justin portrays the maps with this linear-diagram format. It's an easy way to see how linear your dungeon really is. It strips out all of the geography and just shows connections between the rooms.

Bone Marshes has several sections: Aboveground, Underground, Sunken Keep, Spire, Lava Maze, and The Vault.

The Aboveground areas are a hex-crawl, so this mapping technique won't work because every location is closely connected to nearby locations. However we can do this for the rest of the "dungeons".

## Jaquaying Techniques

Multiple Entrances

Loops

Levels and Connections

Secret paths

Midpoint Entry

Non-Euclidian

## Philosophy

Areas should make logical sense.

Size

Avoid Sprawl

Landmarks

## Conclusion

Obviously a good dungeon doesn't need to include ALL of these things, but they are a good list to keep in mind and consider. I highly suggest you go read the complete series on Alexandrian.
