I decided to use Knave for Bone Marshes because it was popular.

Ben Milton of Questing Beast is an atomic bomb in the RPG community. When he reviews something, that thing explodes. When he releases something, everyone explodes. He's great.

So I figured I would ride his coat-tails to victory. If I was fast enough, I could be the FIRST adventure to be explicitly based on Knave. But I didn't really like Knave at the time. I didn't DISlike it...but I was mostly thinking of the marketing when I made that decision.

## But now....

I've warmed up to it in a pretty big way. 

- Numbers are simple.
- No dump stats
- Classless
- Great Spells
- Item Slots are awesome

## Bastionland is coming

But as much as I enjoy knave I cannot deny my love for Into the Odd

- Combat is fast, lethal, and SATISFYING!
- just three stats
- character generation is fun
- Incredible GM advice from blog
- more rogue-like

## Two Great Tastes

I use them for different games:

Knave is perfect for running old modules, or pre-made stuff. 

BL is great for silly one-shots (which I do A LOT), and shorter term games.
