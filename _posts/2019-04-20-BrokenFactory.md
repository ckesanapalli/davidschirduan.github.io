Bone Marshes is coming along nicely! 

But this post isn't about that. It's about something else I made...sorry, I mean:

## Something My Wife and I Made Together! 

Lauren has always been such a huge supporter of my nonsense, but she's been reluctant to dive in an make her own stuff. 

So when I saw Skerples [Indefinite Train Project](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/03/osr-indefinite-train-community-project.html), I knew this would be the perfect little project for us to work on together. 

Before I go any further:

### [Download the Broken Factory](/files/Broken_Factory.pdf)

A broken factory train-car. If the PCs can repair the factory, they gain a useful robot ally! Too bad there's no instruction manual...

I hope you enjoy it! 

## Now YOU try!

The concept of an infinite train that travels through strange dimensions and unknown worlds immediately captivated us. To make things even better, Skerples includes a pre-made template and blank maps just ready to be flesh out! It was really easy to jump right in and get started. 

I highly recommend you try your hand at it because you can kill two birds with one stone:

## [One Page Dungeon Contest](https://www.dungeoncontest.com/)

It's happening again this year! Dozens of creative...wait...really? Hundreds?! Wow. 

Hundreds of creative adventures squeezed to fit on a single page. It's such a great format for D&D, and stretches creators to their limits. I've never been able to participate before, BUT since we've already made a dungeon for Skerples train, why not submit to the One Page contest as well! 

So go check out the [Indefinite Train Project](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/03/osr-indefinite-train-community-project.html), make your car, then submit it again to the [One Page Dungeon Contest](https://www.dungeoncontest.com/)! Let me know if you do; I'd love to see what you come up with.
