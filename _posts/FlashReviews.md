I have bought a LOT of stuff. And I probably won't get to read/play all of it any time soon. SO! in order to turn cleaning into content, here's a bunch of quick impressions/surface thoughts of my backlog.

I will label every item as one of:

- **Will Play.** I'll play this eventually, and will review it after I play it once or twice.
- **Will Review.** I'll read it later and post a longer review on my site. Might play, might not.
- **Archive.** I'm going to move it to the archive for now. Maybe I'll pick it up again, maybe not. Nothing really grabbed me.
- **Delete.** Definitely won't ever read or play this. Sadness.

These labels are **NOT** a reflection of quality, just my interest in playing/reading/reviewing them further. I only have so much time. For some reason or another I bought them; so if they are on this list, they piqued my interest already.

If I miss something, or get things completely wrong, let me know in the comments! I'd love an excuse to take a closer look at this stuff.

## Troika! (Will Play)

This thing is wildly imaginative! Holy crap. Flavor and lore ooze out of every page, and drop down all over my brain. _That was a weird sentence...whatever, just keep going._

Not only are the classes brilliant, but the creature and spell descriptions are amazing! listen to the description for "Darksee":

> "The wizard reaches into their sockets and extricates their eyes. Thus freed, the dark void behind can see perfectly well in pitch blackness and suffer excruciating pain in light (-4 penalty to all rolls). Be careful not to lose those eyeballs as re-inserting them is the only way to end the Spell."

I can't wait to get this to the table. I also made a fancy [generator/turn tracker](/troikagenerator) for it!

## TinyDungeon 2E (Archive)

This made the rounds on KS, and while nothing really grabbed me at first I've been curious to check it out.

Mechanics are simple, almost boringly so. Roll 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6 depending on skills and penalties. If any of the dice land on 5 or 6 you succeed. Successful attacks deal 1 damage. Traits grant additional powers or advantages. 

Most of the value in the book comes from the 20 "micro-settings". These tweak the rules a bit, are set in different worlds/realities/timezones.

It looks....boring. But maybe some of the microsettings are fun. I would grab this if I wanted to play a REALLY simple RPG. Archived.

## Spire (Will Review)

Gosh this book is pretty. The artwork by Adrian Stone sold me completely. 

Although I like it I don't know if I'll play it. It has a darker tone than something like Blades in the Dark (one of my faves). Dark to the point of heaviness. I can see this bringing up some deep issues during play.

And that is not a bad thing! But often I play with co-workers or strangers; not a lot of room for depth. Definitely want to give it a good read-through!

## Nightmares Underneath (Delete)

I actualy like a lot of things about this book, but mostly the concept: Dungeons are actually portals to nightmares that must be explored and closed.

Very cool.

But the book seems overly complex and fiddly for most of the stuff I play. 

Patrick Stuart did a better review (and more complete) [here](http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2017/04/a-review-of-nightmares-underneath-by.html).

## Macchiato Monsters (Delete)

I wanted to like this more. But I've read SO MANY OSR systems over the past 6 months that it takes a lot to jump out an grab me. 

Sorry Macchiato Monsters. It looks like a solid game, all the bells and whistles. But nothing that exploded my brain and made me want to run to the table. 

## Red Markets (Delete)

I was never really into zombie survival games, but an RPG based around econonics intrigued me. Sadly it seems REALLY fiddly and book-keepy. Not that I should be surprised...I don't really know what I was expecting.

HOWEVER! The first 100 pages or so are an incredible short-story about how The Crash happened, and what the world looks like now. I read that whole section and couldn't tear myself away. If you like zombie fiction, it's worth the purchase just for the introduction.

## Into the Wyrd and Wild (Will Play)

I already wrote a random generator for this...just waiting for it to be publicly available before I write a longer review and take it for a spin.

## Ravenloft - I6, AD&D (Will Play)

I want to play this so bad. I might tweak some of the encounter tables to make it more spicy...but still. 

That castle map is GORGEOUS! and I want to try it. 

SOOOOON! Hopefully.

## Expedition to Barrier Peaks (Archive)

I bought this one after I read Ravenloft. Oh man. These maps are UGLY, and the text is UGLY and the paragraphs are HUUUGE! I would basically have to re-write this whole thing to use it at the table. 

No thanks. 

## Roots of Bitterness (Delete)

The long paragraphs caused my eyes to glaze over, and the setting didn't really grab me. 
I skimmed it and never really got a sense for what the purpose of the adventure was. Explore the hidden temple? Defeat the roaming cossacks? Eat a bunch of Elk?

## No Salvation for Witches (Delete)

starts with this setence:

> This is not a low-prep adventure. NSFW is a cheerfully gory adventure inspired by slasher movies and heavy metal. This isn’t grimdark, it’s glibdark. Have fun!

I just NOPE'D right out of their. Doesn't sound like my jam at all.

## Monolith Beyond Space and Time (Archive)

At least he's honest at the start.

> A twist or two will momentarily break the tension until the ramifications set in, and then they hit climax where they realize that they cannot win. They are doomed, and were doomed from the moment they got involved.

> You do not want to do this to your players very often, mind you. You probably do not want to do it to them at all. You are their Referee, likely their friend, and feelings would be hurt. Well that is what I, as the author, am here for. You are not doing it to them. I am. You are not responsible.

That's bullshit. I bought, chose, and prepped this adventure. I am 100% responsible! 

But let's keep reading, I'm intrigued, at the very least.

_Reads a few more pages_ 

This adventure is a giant kick in the teeth to your players. At one point they can become **allergic to water**! And yes, they still need to drink.

I kinda like it, because it's wildly imaginative and weird. Worth stealing ideas from. But I would NEVER run this as written.

## Broodmother Skyfortress (Will Review)

I've heard a lot about this adventure, and it looks interesting enough that I'll want to read it more in the future. The GM advice in particular looks solid.

Don't know if I'll play it yet....

## Challenge of the Frog Idol (Will Play)

I love rumor tables. Good stuff. Nice description of the nearby town and what's happening there. I love the causeways mechanic.

Alright, I'm sold. This looks clever and fun. 

## Hyqueous Vaults (Will Play)

This map looks amazing. Locations are pretty terse and straightforward. Puzzles look like fun. SOLD! 

## Gone Fishin' (Will Play)

Includes a soup recipe. Okay.

LOVE LOVE LOVE the starting concept. Sounds like a real local legend.

This has a great tone; light-hearted and funny. 

"Fop 2nd level fighter hp 10 AC 2 (plate mail + shield) Alignment stupid, Weapons long sword & dagger"

I really like the light-hearted tone and quest. Would be perfect for a quiet saturday evening with friends.

## In The Woods (Monster Parts) (Delete)

Creepy walk in grimdark woods. Meh.

## Mines Claws and Princesses (Will Play)

Great layout! The artwork is a little rough, but clear. It has charm.

I bet I could run this thing with minimal prep.

## Orcs in Tarodun's Tomb (Will Play)

Claims to be a good fit for first time players. I'm down.

The orc generator is gold.

Nice, clean, small map. OH LAYOUT! Be still my heart. Gorgeous.

I'm sold. I'll run this.

## Slumbering Ursine Dunes (Will Play)

Slavic mythic-inspired (with an acid fantasy-twist) with 25 point-crawl locations and two dungeons. 

Hell yeah.

I've heard a bunch of great stuff about this adventure, just waiting for the next opportunity.

## Gates of Cold Iron Pass (Archived)

This is a small dungeon/encounter/setpiece that can be used as a one-shot or a stop on long journeys.

I admire the flexibility of the design, and how much of a personal setup this is. Named dwarves, motivations, various outcomes. 

It's good.

But I don't think I'll ever use it. Maybe one day!

## Black Pudding Heavy Helping (Will Play)

Aside from the incredible artwork I LOVE these classes. So creative and clever, especially fresh in the OSR scene.

This book is just full of gold. Items, hirelines, sentient weapons, clever creatures, 

But the reasons I bought it is for the adventures. These are just beautiful, succinct, and imaginative. Definitely gonna run these.

## Veins of the Earth (Will Review)

I know I know. How have I not read this yet? Well it's hard for me to read stuff unless I know I'm going to play it soon. And underground adventures just don't seem likely any time soon. 

But I am definitely gonna sit down and read it. Soon! 

## What Ho, Frog Demons! (Will Play)

I love the art. Bought it before I got the chance to play Slumbering Ursine Dunes, which seems a bit derpy. 

Gotta play both of these. 

Love the hexcrawl. All the maps in fact. 

## Dyson's Delve Deluxe (Will Play)

Wow, the information compression here is...impressive! 

Looks like a clear, clever dungeon. 

Each level fits on a single page, which is PERFECT for one-shots and quick games.

Can't wait to take this for a spin.

## Atarin's Delve (Archived)

Seems a bit....samey? But I like the maps, and it seems clear enough to run.

## Blood Moon Rising (Will Review)

I really like the town festival as a backdrop to an adventure. Town events, ancient histories and legends, nearby tombs. 

Sounds awesome.
