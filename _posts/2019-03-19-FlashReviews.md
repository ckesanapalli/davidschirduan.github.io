So I have bought a LOT of stuff. And I probably won't get to read/play all of it any time soon.

SO! in order to turn cleaning into content, here's a bunch of quick impressions/surface thoughts of my backlog.

I will label every item as one of:

- **Will Play.** I'll play this eventually, and will review it after I play it once or twice.
- **Will Review.** I'll read it later and post a longer review on my site. Might play, might not.
- **Archive.** I'm going to move it to the archive for now. Maybe I'll pick it up again, maybe not. Nothing really grabbed me.
- **Delete.** Definitely won't ever read or play this. Sadness.

These labels are NOT a reflection of quality, just my interest in playing/reading/reviewing them further. I only have so much time. For some reason or another I bought them; so if they are on this list, they piqued my interest already.

If I miss something, or get things completely wrong, let me know in the comments! I'd love an excuse to take a closer look at this stuff.

## Troika! (Will Play)

This thing is wildly imaginative! Holy crap. Flavor and lore ooze out of every page, and drop down all over my brain. _That was a weird sentence...whatever, just keep going._

Not only are the classes brilliant, but the creature and spell descriptions are amazing! listen to the description for "Darksee":

> "The wizard reaches into their sockets and extricates their eyes. Thus freed, the dark void behind can see perfectly well in pitch blackness and suffer excruciating pain in light (-4 penalty to all rolls). Be careful not to lose those eyeballs as re-inserting them is the only way to end the Spell."

I can't wait to get this to the table. I also made a fancy [generator/turn tracker](/troikagenerator) for it!

## TinyDungeon 2E (Archive)

This made the rounds on KS, and while nothing really grabbed me at first I've been curious to check it out.

Mechanics are simple, almost boringly so. Roll 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6 depending on skills and penalties. If any of the dice land on 5 or 6 you succeed. Successful attacks deal 1 damage. Traits grant additional powers or advantages. 

Most of the value in the book comes from the 20 "micro-settings". These tweak the rules a bit, are set in different worlds/realities/timezones.

It looks....boring. But maybe some of the microsettings are fun. I would grab this if I wanted to play a REALLY simple RPG. Archived.

## Spire (Will Review)

Gosh this book is pretty. The artwork by Adrian Stone sold me completely. 

Although I like it I don't know if I'll play it. It has a darker tone than something like Blades in the Dark (one of my faves). Dark to the point of heaviness. I can see this bringing up some deep issues during play.

And that is not a bad thing! But often I play with co-workers or strangers; not a lot of room for depth. Definitely want to give it a good read-through!

## Nightmares Underneath (Delete)

I actualy like a lot of things about this book, but mostly the concept: Dungeons are actually portals to nightmares that must be explored and closed.

Very cool.

But the book seems overly complex and fiddly for most of the stuff I play. 

Patrick Stuart did a better review (and more complete) [here](http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2017/04/a-review-of-nightmares-underneath-by.html).

## Macchiato Monsters (Delete)

I wanted to like this more. But I've read SO MANY OSR systems over the past 6 months that it takes a lot to jump out an grab me. 

Sorry Macchiato Monsters. It looks like a solid game, all the bells and whistles. But nothing that exploded my brain and made me want to run to the table. 

## Red Markets (Delete)

I was never really into zombie survival games, but an RPG based around econonics intrigued me. Sadly it seems REALLY fiddly and book-keepy. Not that I should be surprised...I don't really know what I was expecting.

HOWEVER! The first 100 pages or so are an incredible short-story about how The Crash happened, and what the world looks like now. I read that whole section and couldn't tear myself away. If you like zombie fiction, it's worth the purchase just for the introduction.

## Into the Wyrd and Wild (Will Play)

I already wrote a random generator for this...just waiting for it to be publicly available before I write a longer review and take it for a spin.

## Ravenloft - I6, AD&D (Will Play)

I want to play this so bad. I might tweak some of the encounter tables to make it more spicy...but still. 

That castle map is GORGEOUS! and I want to try it. 

SOOOOON! Hopefully.

## Expedition to Barrier Peaks (Archive)

I bought this one after I read Ravenloft. Oh man. These maps are UGLY, and the text is UGLY and the paragraphs are HUUUGE! I would basically have to re-write this whole thing to use it at the table. 

No thanks.
