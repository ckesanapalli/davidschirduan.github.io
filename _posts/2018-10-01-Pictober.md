The **good news**: I'm planning to expand [The Bone Marshes](/bone-marshes) into a huge 50-60 page book with updated maps and content! Woohoo! 

The **bad news**: All of my writing energy is going towards this new project, and I won't be able to update the blog with cool stuff...cool writing stuff anyway.

I've always hated taking pictures and being in pictures, even as a kid. I respect the art and skills involved in photography, but I always saw it as an attempt to artificially preserve moments; sometimes at the cost of experiencing them.

However recently I've changed my mind. I found myself incredibly thankful for the few pictures I've taken and now I wish I had taken more over the past 3-4 years.

## Day 0

![day0.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day0.jpg)

So time to try out this photography thing. I'll be taking a picture every day for the month of October and adding it to this post. I'll be using the [#inktober2018](https://inktober.com/rules/)

## Day 1: Poisonous

![day1.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day1.jpg)

Over the past month or two I've been trying to take control of my eating habits. I replace breakfast and lunch of every day with [Soylent](https://soylent.com/), a meal replacement shake. It's been working pretty well...

Until this morning. The soylent I had to drink had already been opened, and was extremely disgusting. I nearly poisoned myself!

## Day 2: Tranquil

![day2.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day2.jpg)

We've owned this little girl for over a year, and I can't imagine my life without her. 

When she nestled up next to me and falls asleep I experience true tranquility.

## Day 3: Roasted

![day3.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day3.jpg)

Part of this little challenge is to force me to try new things; embrace new experiences. I couldn't think of what to take a picture of for roasting, so I tried my hand at making some sweet potato chips. 

They turned out pretty good! Definitely adding these to my repertoire. 

## Day 4: Spell

![day4.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day4.jpg)

Sometimes Lauren brings home some of the arts and crafts that she worked on with her kids at school. Seeing them around the house brightens my mood and makes me a little more excited about having kids of our own someday. 

Still terrified, but pictures like these increase the appeal!

## Day 5: Chicken

![day5.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day5.jpg)

I couldn't think of anything to do for chicken. So I opened up photoshop and messed around with stuff for a while. Came up with this at the end of it. Ori HATES that vacuum cleaner, and always runs upstairs to hide/growl. 

Now I'll think of this weird image...

## Day 6: Drool

![day6.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day6.jpg)

I enjoyed messing around in photoshop with yesterday's image...let's do that again!

Grilled Peanut Butter Jelly Sandwhich is one of my favorite snacks, and I make it all the time. Might have gone a bit overboard with the jelly this time...

## Day 7: Exhausted

![day7.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day7.jpg)

Our first couch was more like small, uncomfortable patio furniture than anything else. Our current couch is still crappy, but it's a comfortable kind of crappy.

At the end of a long day, it feels great to become one with the couch.

## Day 8: Star

![day8.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day8.png)

Lauren sings so beautifully. I always thought she could end up on a concert poster if she didn't hate crowds. I'll take any excuse to take her picture and look at her beautiful face.

## Day 9: Precious

![day9.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day9.png)

I think this speaks for itself...

## Day 10: Flow

![day10.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day10.png)

Woke up this morning to see a huge puddle beneath the sink. The landlord we have is fantastic, and we've had very few problems over the past 3 years. Hopefully this doesn't turn out to be too big of an issue...

## Day 11: Cruel

![day11.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day11.png)

No picture for this one...just thinking about the prompt made me sad. I didn't want to spend my day dwelling on "Cruel". So here's the result of a photoshop tutorial I did earlier today.

## Day 12: Whale

![day12.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day12.png)

Today's image comes from a deep place in my heart. For too long whales have been imprisoned within our cold waters. It's time to let them fly freely!

## Day 13: Guard

![day13.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day13.png)

Ori is neither fierce nor intimidating. But I still feel safer with her around. Or maybe I just like warm fuzzy things. One of the two.

## Day 14/15: Clock/Weak

![day14-15.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day14-15.png)

Today I'm catching up. I couldn't think of anything for day 14 (Clock), so I combined 14 and 15 together into a shitty motivational poster.

![prayer_groans.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/prayer_groans.png)

The other image was inspired by an episode of [The Bridge Podcast](https://thebridgepodcast.podbean.com/e/259-why-keep-praying/). I've been struggling with prayer, and this sermon and verse was extremely encouraging to me.

## Day 16/17: Angular/Swollen

![day16-17.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day16-17.jpg)

Again I'm catching up. I combined 16 and 17 into a small PSA about fonts.

![rookflowchart.png]({{site.url}}/images/posts/rookflowchart.png)

A simple flowchart for Rook, a big scary grappling character from [Fantasy Strike](https://technicalgrimoire.com/david/2018/09/How-to-Win-a-Fantasy-Strike-Tournament). I do'nt see nearly enough people taking advantage of his many options, so I made a simple flowchart to help explain.

## Day 18/19/20: Bottle/Scorched/Breakable

![day18.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day18.jpg)

This was the first bottle that came to mind when I saw that prompt, which was really weird. I don't drink much; only go through 2-3 bottles over the course of a year.

But as soon as I saw bottle, it popped into my head. I wonder if that says something about me...

![day19.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day19.png)

Building upon the Bottle prompt from yesterday, I tried to make it look like I was pouring out fire. But that's REALLY hard to pull off convincingly, especially because of all the metallic surfaces and tricky lighting. So I gave up, and now you look upon a goofy attempt.

![day20.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day20.png)

I had much more success breaking the bottle. In photoshop I mean, not in real life. The cracked glass turned out pretty good! This was way more fun than fire.

## Day 21/22: Drain/Expensive

![day21-22.png]({{site.url}}/images/pictober2018/day21-22.png)

This month Lauren and I paid off all of her student loans! This is a major achievement and we are so relived. Only a few of my loans remain. Draining and Expensive indeed!

## Aaaaaand I'm done!

I know I didn't complete all 31 days, but I'm definitely done. I'd rather spend my time on [The Bone Marshes](https://technicalgrimoire.com/bone-marshes), and other blog posts.

Thanks for joining me on this little adventure! Maybe next year I'll make it all 31 days.
