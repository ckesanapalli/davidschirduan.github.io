A Sci-fi horror adventure.

![OnlyThe-Cover.png]({{site.url}}/images/posts/OnlyThe-Cover.png){: .rightSmallImg}

A Sci-Fi horror adventure for the [Dread system]({{site.url}}/david/extremely-interesting-role-playing-games#dread). Dread is perfect for running a horror/thriller game, and uses a Jenga tower instead of dice to keep the tension high! Players are stranded on a damaged ship with a broken AI, and must survive long enough to repair their vessel and try to escape with their lives.
