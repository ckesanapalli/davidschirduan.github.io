Like I explained before, I'm going to embrace this new [blogpocalypse](/david/2018/10/blogpocalypse) as long as my sanity will let me.

One of the most important parts of this process is sharing the blogs and posts of others. Inoreader makers this really easy: when I read something cool, I can star it for later. Then, at the end of the month I just go through my starred posts. So, let's jump right in! 

## [Rattled](https://detectmagic.wordpress.com/rattled/)

![blogroll-rattled.jpg]({{site.url}}/images/posts/blogroll-rattled.jpg){: .leftSmallImg}

A great attempt at making a phone-based RPG. It includes a character generator, rules, etc. I think the idea has a lot of potential, but it's limited by layout the small screen size of phones. I mean, a full-size RPG hardcover can present about 15 times the content of the average phone across its two pages. 

But I'm always glad to see people trying new things; maybe I'll give it a try. Especially since the mood music is [ON POINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-ZGAGcJrk)!

## [Purple Worm with Pornstars](http://www.wizardthieffighter.com/2018/purple-worm-with-pornstars/)

I love this article. Luka breaks down how the support of the RPG community helped him get through a hard time and pushed him to create some incredible things.

This is what we cannot afford to lose as G+ fades away. The encouragement, the collaberation.

## [Commentary on Tomb of the Iron God](https://swordsandstitchery.blogspot.com/2018/10/osr-campaign-commentary-o-edition.html)

I love reading good reviews. This one delivers with context for the adventure, praise for the clever history, and excitement about what comes next. 

Makes me really want to play it.

## [The Wilderness Dungeon, An Essay](https://thewyrdandwild.wordpress.com/2018/10/26/the-wilderness-dungeon-an-essay/)

This article gave me a new perspective on wilderness exploration. I wonder if I can apply some of its points to The Bone Marshes.

It ends with this brilliant line: "Perhaps the dungeon was built to keep the wilderness out."

## [The Dreams of Trees](https://archonsmarchon.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-dreams-of-trees-are-awful-things.html)

Going along with the post above, this is a fascinating perspective on viewing trees. The post describes them a vicious creatures waging war on a scale of hundreds of years. 

I love stuff like this.

## [Don't Know What to Write](https://journeyintotheweird.blogspot.com/2018/10/i-dont-know-what-to-write.html)

I include this not because of the content, but because of the tone. THe honesty, the vulnerability. Really good stuff that I hope to see more of in these blogs, and in my own.

## [Room Descriptions](https://bogeymanscave.blogspot.com/2018/10/how-to-write-usable-room-descriptions.html)

This is gold. USEABLE being the key word. It takes SO much more effort to parse a bloated adventure than a sleek well organized one. 

This advice is going DIRECTLY into the Bone Marshes.
