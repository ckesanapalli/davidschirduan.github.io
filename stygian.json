      "description": "The shelves here are lined with glass jars, each filled with a clear fluid. Floating in the fluid is an intact human brain, with wires linking where the spinal column would be to a small mechanism set in the jar’s base. Each jar is labelled to say who’s brain it contains, and when they were interred.<br>Each jar’s fluid is a nutrient solution designed to keep the brain within alive. Occasionally, a bubble rises to the surface as the jar’s mechanisms keep the fluid oxygenated. The mechanism links to a small metal grille in front of the jar; this is how the brain within communicates, in a tinny, staticky voice. The brains are torpid and dormant as the PCs enter, but can be roused by for example shaking their jars or speaking directly into the grille at the front of their jar.<br>Of the brains present, at least one (perhaps more) will be an intellectual figure (recent or historical) known to the PCs. 1-in-4 chance that it’s somebody directly connected to the subject of the PCs’ research. Conversing with this figure might answer all sorts of questions, and adds 4 to the party’s progress score if their area of knowledge is relevant. Being stuck in a jar has almost certainly given the brain a long time to spend in self-reflection with little external stimulus. It has no doubt become deeply strange in its outlook and priorities.<br>The remaining brains are split roughly evenly between those incapable of intelligible communication due to language barriers, those incapable of intelligible communication due to total jar-induced madness, those unable to be roused from their torpor, and those with little worth saying.<br>A brain-in-a-jar exists in a weird halfway state between life and death. It is affected just as easily by magic that affects the living, the dead and the undead.<br>1-in-4 encounters here will always be with Floating Brains (P. 48)."
