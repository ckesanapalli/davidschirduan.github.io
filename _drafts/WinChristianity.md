If you're going to do something, do it well, right? Be the best. Win. Sit at the top. 

I think that's a noble goal in any profession or hobby. Since I probably won't be the best programmer, writer, or designer perhaps I should try excelling at Christianity. 

Should be easy right? Anyone can be a Christian. It's all about love and peace or somesuch. Even [our President](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-trump-bible-huckster-zorn-perspec-1028-md-20161026-column.html) is really good at it.

So...how do we win at Christianity? We'll talk through it and see if we can find some out of context Bible verses to back it up.

## Help the Most People

This one seems the most obvious. If you help the most people, then you're the best at love. Or mercy. Or whatever is in the Bible. 

"Help" is kind of a nebulous term. Paving a road doesn't seem like much, but it impacts thousands of people every day (depending on the road). Meanwhile volunteering at a soup kitchen seems more holy, but you're only helping a couple dozen people every day. LAME.

Money maybe? With a lot of money you can solve a lot of problems. Feed the world, better medicine, and so on. But....if I could make a [lot of money](https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-24.htm), then I wouldn't need to succeed at Christianity. I'd succeed at whatever was making me money. 

If we could all make money, then none of us would need money. Let's focus on normal stuff that anyone could do.

Church pastor. Better yet, a famous pastor. They preach to milllions of people, bringing people to the Lord, spreading the gospel. If we can avoid all the controversy that comes with being famous, then we can impact millions of...

Who am I kidding? I no talk good. How could God use someone who [can't speak nice](https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm)?

So without money or charisma, I probably won't win by helping the most people. Maybe it's not about others. It's about the heart, right? Not about what other people think.

## Being the Most Holy

This one sounds easy. I'm pretty much the holiest person I know already. Just gotta convince everyone else.
