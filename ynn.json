Black inlaid script highlights well formed facial features. Double all XP gained for treasure. Gain no XP for anything that’s not treasure. Gain the minimum HP per Hit Dice on levelling up. The wearer gains a sophisticated taste in art, food, and company. Their subjective tastes are always flawless, nobody of class would disagree with them.<br><i>Take a total of the wearer’s charisma and constitution scores: this is their sense of self. Each day that the mask is worn, reduce that sense of self by 1. When their sense of self is half its starting value, the mask begins to take over. If they ever act in a way that goes against the mask’s archetype, they can gain no XP for the next day. If their sense of self becomes 0, the mask takes over entirely, and they become an NPC Removing a mask is difficult and dangerous. Make a Save vs Magic to do so, or else the mask is stuck fast to the wearer’s face and can’t be removed. Regardless of if the save is passed or failed, the attempt is incredibly painful; the wearer takes d4 damage, plus one more per day the mask’s been worn. The Mask Gallery will only be found once per expedition. Thereafter, treat this result as ‘manicured lawn’ instead.</i>"

Towering glass-and-steel edifices, the splicing vats let you combine disparate living things to produce the various marvellous hybrids of the gardens. The vats are two stories tall, glass tubes like a md scientist might grow clones in. There’s all manner of tubes and pipes going in and out. The whole thing is filled with a slightly cloudy pinkish or greenish liquid. There’s a hatch in the front, latched shut, bit enough for a person to crawl through. There’s another little inlet valve, just big enough to poke your finger into. There’s a control panel, too, a brass and blackiron plate with five unmarked buttons on it. Using the Vats properly is difficult. <br><strong>The correct method works like this:</strong><br>1. Open the hatch, drain the fluid, and put the new test subject to be spliced into the vat.<br>2. Press the correct button, to fill the vat with amniotic fluid.<br>3. Introduce some genetic matter into the little inlet valve. Blood works fine, sap works fine, flesh works fine. Eggs and seeds will do, too.<br>4. Procedure A, B, C or D is selected, depending on the intended result. Perhaps al combination. Perhaps this is repeated.<br>5. The hatch is opened, and the newly modified creature comes out.<br>A. This procedure passes subtle traits from the donated genetic material onto the subject. So, put in a human’s DNA, and a human subject’s face might warp to look like them. Put in a tiger’s DNA, and a plant’s leaves develop tiger-stripes. ‘A’ stands for ‘Appearance’<br>B. This procedure morphs the subject into a half-and-half hybrid with the introduced DNA. So, put in an owl and a bear, select ‘B’ and get an owlbear. Put in a human and a butterfly, and get a pixie. ‘B’ stands for ‘Blend’.<br>C. This procedure gives the subject a noteworthy trait from the genetic material introduced. Human DNA makes the subject sentient like a human. Spider DNA lets them spin webs. Bat DNA gives the echolocation. Mushroom DNA makes them spew reproductive spores. Elephant DNA makes them grow a trunk and tusks. ‘C’ stands for ‘capabilities’.<br>D. This procedure makes the effects of any previous stuff done to the subject inheritable. ‘D’ stands for ‘DNA;<br><br><strong>Of course, players will probably get this wrong.</strong><br> If they put genetic material into the tank in step 1, rather than a whole being, the vats produce a helpless foetus that dies when removed.<br> If they put another living thing through the hatch in stage 3, any button press produces a horrible cronenbergian mishmash monster.<br> If there’s no amniotic fluid added in stage 2, then each alteration causes horrible wounds. D20 damage, maybe.<br> Pressing buttons A-D without a subject results only in some splurting noises.<br><i>As a GM, you will have to homebrew some rules if the players do this to each other.

Anything inside is struck and takes the brunt of the shock, hence the lack of vegetation. Getting zapped deals 2d6 damage. There’s an extra d6 damage if metal armour is worn. There’s an extra d6 damage for each hand holding a metal item, like a lantern or sword. There’s an extra d6 damage if you’re carrying metal treasure (such as jewellery or coins). No save unless you can somehow dodge lightning. Everybody inside the cage is struck. If removed from the cage, it arcs to the closes big metal thing (bigger than a person).

      "description": "This location wants to eat you. The loam itself is hungry. It can’t see, but it can dimly hear and senses vibrations. If you make much noise or cause much vibration in the ground, it will try to take a bite. A mouth made of loam and clay but with white ivory teeth opens up by the victim’s feet. Roll to hit at +0 to see if the attack hits (bonuses for shields don’t count here). A hit deals d12 damage and clamps the mouth onto the character’s body. It chews for d12 damage each round thereafter until the character either dies (and is swallowed) or pulls free. Causing a mouth pain causes it to let go of whatever’s in it. Anything that causes 5 or more damage in one go will do this, as will anything spicy (like horseradish or chilli), any fire, or particularly pointy things (like caltrops). The mouth spits out whatever’s in it, and seals up to resemble blank turf once more. Any number of mouths can try eating people at once, but only one mouth per person. If you aren’t on the ground (up a tree or on a fence for example), the mouths can’t get you. Speaking doesn’t trigger a mouth, but walking might and running, fighting or other strenuous activity certainly does. Walking carefully has a 50% chance to provoke a mouth. Thieves and other stealthy characters get their normal chance at stealth as an extra save to avoid attracting the mouths no matter what they’re doing, so long as they try to do so stealthily."

Falling asleep is the easiest way, but drinking yourself into a stupor or getting bopped on the head will also do the trick. At the point where a PC falls unconscious, they are transported to the ‘other side’ of the location (although their companions only see them pass out). They wake up in a duplicate of the location, their companions asleep on the ground next to them. This place is much the same, except they can leave freely. They can go back to the ‘enclosed’ version of the place by going back to sleep, which will cause them to wake up in the ‘trapped’ version. Time passes the same in both locations. You are asleep in one, and awake in the other. You pass between the two by falling asleep in one to wake in the other."

Their purpose is to gather dead, broken and dirty things, and pile them up in their great steaming compost-mounds to rot down. More composters sprout from the mass periodically, which is also used to fertilize the garden. Myconids have huge nests in the depths of the gardens. Great rotting heaps of compost, with propped-up cavities within where they live. They don’t sleep, or eat, but instead replenish themselves by thrusting the mycelium roots from their hands and feet into the decaying mass that makes up their home. Their consciousness is not as separated as other beings. Myconids can fuse together, letting the mycelium threads that make up their neural networks intertwine. Their consciousnesses merge, their personalities blurr together, they share memories The longer they’re fused, the more completely thei sentiences meld together. They can split apart again, and when they do they retain all the memories they once shared. Myconids greet one another by shaking hands, blurring conciousnesses enough to exchange information. Knowledge ripples through their culture rapidly, their personalities exist in a fluid pool. They are extraordinarily vulnerable to memetic corruption. They wear dungarees and battered straw hats, and speak with regional British accents; Cockney or Cornish or Welsh. Stolid and practical, and single-mindedly dedicated to creating the best compost they can. PCs look compostable, too, they’ve got all those nutrients...",
