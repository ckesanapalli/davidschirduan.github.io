The wearer gains a sophisticated taste in art, food, and company. Their subjective tastes are always flawless, nobody of class would disagree with them.<br><i>Take a total of the wearer’s charisma and constitution scores: this is their sense of self. Each day that the mask is worn, reduce that sense of self by 1. When their sense of self is half its starting value, the mask begins to take over. If they ever act in a way that goes against the mask’s archetype, they can gain no XP for the next day. If their sense of self becomes 0, the mask takes over entirely, and they become an NPC Removing a mask is difficult and dangerous. Make a Save vs Magic to do so, or else the mask is stuck fast to the wearer’s face and can’t be removed. Regardless of if the save is passed or failed, the attempt is incredibly painful; the wearer takes d4 damage, plus one more per day the mask’s been worn. The Mask Gallery will only be found once per expedition. Thereafter, treat this result as ‘manicured lawn’ instead.</i>"

Towering glass-and-steel edifices, the splicing vats let you combine disparate living things to produce the various marvellous hybrids of the gardens. The vats are two stories tall, glass tubes like a md scientist might grow clones in. There’s all manner of tubes and pipes going in and out. The whole thing is filled with a slightly cloudy pinkish or greenish liquid. There’s a hatch in the front, latched shut, bit enough for a person to crawl through. There’s another little inlet valve, just big enough to poke your finger into. There’s a control panel, too, a brass and blackiron plate with five unmarked buttons on it. Using the Vats properly is difficult. <br><strong>The correct method works like this:</strong><br>1. Open the hatch, drain the fluid, and put the new test subject to be spliced into the vat.<br>2. Press the correct button, to fill the vat with amniotic fluid.<br>3. Introduce some genetic matter into the little inlet valve. Blood works fine, sap works fine, flesh works fine. Eggs and seeds will do, too.<br>4. Procedure A, B, C or D is selected, depending on the intended result. Perhaps al combination. Perhaps this is repeated.<br>5. The hatch is opened, and the newly modified creature comes out.<br>A. This procedure passes subtle traits from the donated genetic material onto the subject. So, put in a human’s DNA, and a human subject’s face might warp to look like them. Put in a tiger’s DNA, and a plant’s leaves develop tiger-stripes. ‘A’ stands for ‘Appearance’<br>B. This procedure morphs the subject into a half-and-half hybrid with the introduced DNA. So, put in an owl and a bear, select ‘B’ and get an owlbear. Put in a human and a butterfly, and get a pixie. ‘B’ stands for ‘Blend’.<br>C. This procedure gives the subject a noteworthy trait from the genetic material introduced. Human DNA makes the subject sentient like a human. Spider DNA lets them spin webs. Bat DNA gives the echolocation. Mushroom DNA makes them spew reproductive spores. Elephant DNA makes them grow a trunk and tusks. ‘C’ stands for ‘capabilities’.<br>D. This procedure makes the effects of any previous stuff done to the subject inheritable. ‘D’ stands for ‘DNA;<br><br><strong>Of course, players will probably get this wrong.</strong><br>‣ If they put genetic material into the tank in step 1, rather than a whole being, the vats produce a helpless foetus that dies when removed.<br>‣ If they put another living thing through the hatch in stage 3, any button press produces a horrible cronenbergian mishmash monster.<br>‣ If there’s no amniotic fluid added in stage 2, then each alteration causes horrible wounds. D20 damage, maybe.<br>‣ Pressing buttons A-D without a subject results only in some splurting noises.<br><i>As a GM, you will have to homebrew some rules if the players do this to each other.

There’s an extra d6 damage for each hand holding a metal item, like a lantern or sword. There’s an extra d6 damage if you’re carrying metal treasure (such as jewellery or coins). No save unless you can somehow dodge lightning. Everybody inside the cage is struck. If removed from the cage, it arcs to the closes big metal thing (bigger than a person).

If you make much noise or cause much vibration in the ground, it will try to take a bite. A mouth made of loam and clay but with white ivory teeth opens up by the victim’s feet. Roll to hit at +0 to see if the attack hits (bonuses for shields don’t count here). A hit deals d12 damage and clamps the mouth onto the character’s body. It chews for d12 damage each round thereafter until the character either dies (and is swallowed) or pulls free. Causing a mouth pain causes it to let go of whatever’s in it. Anything that causes 5 or more damage in one go will do this, as will anything spicy (like horseradish or chilli), any fire, or particularly pointy things (like caltrops). The mouth spits out whatever’s in it, and seals up to resemble blank turf once more. Any number of mouths can try eating people at once, but only one mouth per person. If you aren’t on the ground (up a tree or on a fence for example), the mouths can’t get you. Speaking doesn’t trigger a mouth, but walking might and running, fighting or other strenuous activity certainly does. Walking carefully has a 50% chance to provoke a mouth. Thieves and other stealthy characters get their normal chance at stealth as an extra save to avoid attracting the mouths no matter what they’re doing, so long as they try to do so stealthily."

Falling asleep is the easiest way, but drinking yourself into a stupor or getting bopped on the head will also do the trick. At the point where a PC falls unconscious, they are transported to the ‘other side’ of the location (although their companions only see them pass out). They wake up in a duplicate of the location, their companions asleep on the ground next to them. This place is much the same, except they can leave freely. They can go back to the ‘enclosed’ version of the place by going back to sleep, which will cause them to wake up in the ‘trapped’ version. Time passes the same in both locations. You are asleep in one, and awake in the other. You pass between the two by falling asleep in one to wake in the other."

Each chess set behaves like a miniature knightly court. They engage in courtly politics and romance, war chivalrously with other chess sets or factions in the gardens, and embark on quixotic quests.<br>Each chess set refers to itself by a different name; the Red Court, the White Order, the Ivory Palace and so forth. Their customs are often bizarre but are at least vaguely similar to those of an Arthurian romance. Hospitality, duty, courage, self-sacrifice, and glory are lauded. Cowardice, treachery and unsportsmanlike behaviour is roundly condemned.<br>All pieces of the chess set are forbidden by custom from romance with those outside their class (save for the King and Queen). None the less, the set pursues tangled webs of romance with a dedicated fervour. They are keen to involve outsiderseven PCs in these affairs. A chess-piece lover is a loyal companion, if slighted or betrayed they and their court become an implacable enemy.<br>A chess set cannot be properly destroyed without great effort. If even a few shards of stone remain, the whole set will slowly regenerate. ‘Dead’ members return as if from nowhere within an hour, so long as they are unobserved. As such, although a set may take casualties, those replenish quickly, and soon the set will be back up to full strength.<br>In truth, the set is not 16 creatures, but a single creature with 16 bodies, play acting at different roles, like a human with a puppet on each hand. What one of the set knows, they all know. What one feels, they all feel.<br>Any mind-affecting effects that successfully effect one chess-piece affect them all.<br>1 Rook, 1 Knight, 1 Bishop and 4 pawns are male. The other half are female.<br>Position is everything in fights with a chess set. Those pieces close to one another support one another well, while they jump on isolated PCs and beat them into a pulp.<br>Even if you don’t normally use miniatures, get a chess set out for the fight to track where everybody is. For the purposes of the fight, treat ‘adjacent’ as being ‘within about 3 meters’.<br><br><strong>All chess pieces:</strong><br>‣ Immune to backstabs and other attacks that target vulnerable anatomy. Immune to poison and sickness.<br>‣ Half damage from sharp weapons, fire. Double damage from blunt weapons, cold, electricity.<br>‣ All affected by mental effects that affect at least 1 chess piece.<br>‣ If the king is taken out of action, the rest all fall inert until the king recovers.<br>‣ If unobserved, all chess pieces (even those destroyed, transformed, put somewhere else) return to full strength within an hour and come back together.<br><br><strong>King</strong><br><i>HD 5, HP 20, Armour as Chain + Shield, Smash (+5, d10), saves as fighter 5.</i><br>The supposed ruler of the chess court.

      "description": "The Idea Of Thorns is not a physical creature. It is, instead, somewhere between a disease, a hostile meme, and a spiritual presence. It is conscious. It wants to spread.<br>It does not need host minds to exist, but must find minds to infect if it wishes to affect the physical world. It will try to infect one mind, overtake it utterly, and then spread. It isolates, infects, subverts and controls.<br>When the Idea Of Thorns is first encountered, it will be as information. Writing scrawled on a wall, a little notebook with poetry in it, the sound of distant singing. Anybody who refuses to look, covers their ears, etc, is not attacked by the Idea.<br>Those exposed to the Idea must save vs Magic. Any who fail have the first seeds of the Idea planted in their mind. At this stage, the only sign is that they see all plant life as having thorns. The thorns are real to them, and can cause damage. Hearing somebody infected with the Idea talk about the Idea or their experience of it causes you to make a Save to avoid infection.<br>The Idea can compel an infected victim to take an action: roll a d20: if the result is equal to or higher than the victim’s Sense of Self (which equals charisma + constitution), the victim performs whatever action the Idea wishes.<br>The victim does not realise that the compulsion originated from outside their own mind. The Idea will attempt to lower its victims’ sense of self by <strong>attacking the victim’s minds in the following situations:</strong><br>‣ If a victim experiences an altered state of consciousness, such as drunkenness.<br>‣ If a victim sleeps.<br>‣ If a victim tries to work out an explanation for the Idea.<br>‣ If a victim tries to express the Idea or their experience of it to somebody not yet infected..<br><br>When one of these happens, all those nearby who are infected experience a sudden vision. They are faced with the Idea Of Thorns, incarnate as a towering being made of tangled vines, its form mimicking those whose minds are infected. It has all the moustache-twirling villainous bombast you can hope for. They must fight it. The fight lasts a single round and then ends. The next vision continues the fight where the last left off.<br><br><strong>Treat the Idea Of Thorns as having the following stats:</strong><br>‣ HD as the highest Intelligence out of those infected.<br>‣ 2 HP per HD.<br>‣ Armour Class is the highest Wisdom out of those infected.<br>‣ 3 Attacks with a bonus equal to the highest Charisma out of those infected.<br>‣ Saves as a fighter, level is the lowest Wisdom out of those infected.<br>‣ Immunity to mind-affecting effects. Immunity to poison. Double damage from fire and electricity.<br><br><strong>The Idea does not attack hit-points</strong>, instead it attacks Sense of Self. Each successful hit halves the victim’s Sense of Self (round down).<br>As the victim’s sense of self falls, they will be prone to increasingly irrational behaviour.<br>If a victim has lost any sense of self, the Idea will make the following actions seem appropriate:<br>‣ Producing texts and artworks that express the Idea Of Thorns.<br>‣ Killing those that seek to oppose the Idea Of Thorns.<br>‣ Planting roses, briars, thistles and other thorny plants in places where they will flourish.<br>‣ Abandoning the trappings of civilisation and returning to a more feral state.<br>‣ Destroying buildings and replacing them with plants.<br><br>A victim who does one of these in a way that amuses, impresses or surprises the GM can, at the GM’s whim, earn an XP reward. The amount of XP granted is 50 multiplied by the total amount of Sense of Self they have lost.<br>If the victim’s sense of self reaches 0, they become an NPC, totally enslaved by the Idea.",

      "description": "What elves are to humans, the Sidhe are to elves. These creatures are immortal, unnaturally beautiful, and undeniable geniuses. Their race combined the radiant beauty of angels, the ancient decadence of vampires, and the elegant grace of elves.<br>Once, the Sidhe were the masters of this place. It was built by them as a realm of sophisticated delight. Something changed. The gardens were abandoned, the sidhe are all gone.<br>Something introduced The Idea Of Thorns to the inhabitants, perhaps a visitor from another world or a crack in reality. The Idea swept through the population, seizing the minds of those who encountered it and driving them to bizarre, perverse and frequently deadly acts.<br>Many sidhe died, either from violence or as a result of their hubris leading them astray. Those outside sealed the gardens to prevent the meme-virus spreading. Those that remain are beautiful creatures. Taller and slenderer than humans, with the same delicacy to their features as elves, but more so. A sidhe’s appearance is beauty incarnate.<br>Every sidhe is unique, but they share the following basic characteristics:<br><br><strong>Roll a few d20s for what’s unusual about this Sidhe’s appearance:</strong><br>1. No/additional eyes<br>2. Six-inch-long fingers<br>3. Snake Fangs<br>4. Goat legs<br>5. Butterfly wings<br>6. Petals for hair<br>7. Green/Violet/Blue/Grey/Black/White skin.<br>8. Dressed in furs<br>9. Wearing a crown<br>10. Longhookedfingernails<br>11. Teeth made of glass/flint/silver<br>12. Weeping blood<br>13. Surroundedbyswarmingbutterflies<br>14. Flowers grow in their footsteps<br>15. Surrounded by mist<br>16. Glows with a radiant inner light<br>17. Thorns grow out of their skin where the bone is close to the surface<br>18. Dressed in armour<br>19. Antlers<br>20. Spiders crawling all over their skin.<br><br>All Sidhe carry the Idea Of Thorns.<br>Never surprised..<br>Halve damage from weapons (save those made of iron), poison, cold. Double damage from iron. 50% chance that any mental effect on them fails: their mind is too alien.<br>Animals will not willingly attack a sidhe. Native inhabitants of Ynn will obey any instruction a sidhe gives them; they were made to serve.<br>Each Sidhe is a spellcaster of unusual potency. If they spend their action in combat casting a spell, they can instead cast two spells so long as both are different.<br>At-will: Command, Unseen Servant, Crate Illusion, Forget, Detect Magic.<br>Twice per encounter: Hold Person, Suggestion, Dispel Magic, Invisibility.<br>Once an encounter: Animate Objects, Teleport.<br><br>Typically, the sidhe fights by using commands, illusions and suggestions to turn its enemies against one another, while protecting itself with its remaining spells. In addition, the Sidhe has some other spells it can cast, once per encounter. <br><strong>Roll d12 for what:</strong><br>1. Animate Dead Monsters (twice)<br>2. Fireball (twice)<br>3. Sleep (twice)<br>4. Wall of Stone & Shape Stone.<br>5. Animate Plants (twice)<br>6. Mass Suggestion<br>7. Time Stop<br>8. True Sight<br>9. Earthquake<br>10. Mind Reading (at will)<br>11. Control Weather<br>12. Flesh to Stone & Stone to Flesh<br><br>If the sidhe is reduced to 0 HP, instead of dying it transforms into a patch of flowers or mushrooms growing where their body falls. They regain 1 HP twice a day (sunrise and sunset) until fully healed, and return to flesh when on full HP or if blood soaks into the ground where they’re growing. A stake in the heart prevents this and freezes the sidhe at 0hp until the stake is removed. Destroying the body while it is staked kills the sidhe permanently.<br>Give them any other weird fairy-tale weaknesses, powers or traits you feel are interesting. Each sidhe is unique.",

Each chess set behaves like a miniature knightly court. They engage in courtly politics and romance, war chivalrously with other chess sets or factions in the gardens, and embark on quixotic quests.<br>Each chess set refers to itself by a different name; the Red Court, the White Order, the Ivory Palace and so forth. Their customs are often bizarre but are at least vaguely similar to those of an Arthurian romance. Hospitality, duty, courage, self-sacrifice, and glory are lauded. Cowardice, treachery and unsportsmanlike behaviour is roundly condemned.<br>All pieces of the chess set are forbidden by custom from romance with those outside their class (save for the King and Queen). None the less, the set pursues tangled webs of romance with a dedicated fervour. They are keen to involve outsiderseven PCs in these affairs. A chess-piece lover is a loyal companion, if slighted or betrayed they and their court become an implacable enemy.<br>A chess set cannot be properly destroyed without great effort. If even a few shards of stone remain, the whole set will slowly regenerate. ‘Dead’ members return as if from nowhere within an hour, so long as they are unobserved. As such, although a set may take casualties, those replenish quickly, and soon the set will be back up to full strength.<br>In truth, the set is not 16 creatures, but a single creature with 16 bodies, play acting at different roles, like a human with a puppet on each hand. What one of the set knows, they all know. What one feels, they all feel.<br>Any mind-affecting effects that successfully effect one chess-piece affect them all.<br>1 Rook, 1 Knight, 1 Bishop and 4 pawns are male. The other half are female.<br>Position is everything in fights with a chess set. Those pieces close to one another support one another well, while they jump on isolated PCs and beat them into a pulp.<br>Even if you don’t normally use miniatures, get a chess set out for the fight to track where everybody is. For the purposes of the fight, treat ‘adjacent’ as being ‘within about 3 meters’.<br><br><strong>All chess pieces:</strong><br>‣ Immune to backstabs and other attacks that target vulnerable anatomy. Immune to poison and sickness.<br>‣ Half damage from sharp weapons, fire. Double damage from blunt weapons, cold, electricity.<br>‣ All affected by mental effects that affect at least 1 chess piece.<br>‣ If the king is taken out of action, the rest all fall inert until the king recovers.<br>‣ If unobserved, all chess pieces (even those destroyed, transformed, put somewhere else) return to full strength within an hour and come back together.<br><br><strong>King</strong><br><i>HD 5, HP 20, Armour as Chain + Shield, Smash (+5, d10), saves as fighter 5.</i><br>The supposed ruler of the chess court.
