The water itself is black; it goes much, much deeper. Trees grow close to it sticking their jagged, hungry roots into the space above the river. You see corpses tangled in the roots, dangling above the river like horrid lures. Some of them still have gear with them, armor that sparkles and weapons that glint with power.

Slightly at first, until it finally splits and reflections in reality begin to occur.
