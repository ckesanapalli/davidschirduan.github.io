  "Roles":[
    ["Brute", "<strong>Brute</strong> monsters have more hit points and damage, but less defense. They specialize in dealing damage in melee. They don’t hit as often as other monsters, but they deal a lot of damage when they hit. They don’t move around a lot, and they’re often big. Use brutes in an encounter to threaten the PCs while shielding other monsters with their great size and imminent threat."],
    ["Assassin", "<strong>Assassin</strong> monsters have more damage and speed but less hit points. They have some ability that lets them avoid attacks, usually by striking from hiding. They usually deliver one devastating attack every few rounds, while concentrating on defense in between.  Use assassins as surprise additions to encounters with other monsters."],
    ["Artillery", "<strong>Artillery</strong> monsters excel at ranged combat but have less defense. These creatures rain arrows, explosive fireballs, and similar attacks on the party from a distance. Use artillery monsters in an encounter to hang behind defenders and brutes and rain damage down on the PCs from protected positions."],
    ["Minion", "<strong>Minion</strong> monsters deal less damage and destroyed when they take any amount of damage but always appear in numbers. They are designed to serve as shock troops and cannon fodder. Use minions as melee combatants placed between the PCs and back-rank artillery, controller or support monsters."],
    ["Controller", "<strong>Controller</strong> monsters manipulate their enemies or the battlefield to their advantage. Position controller monsters just behind a front line of melee-focused monsters, and use them to attack the PCs at short range with their control powers. Assign at least one controlling ability for this monster regardless of its trait."],
    ["Support", "<strong>Support</strong> monsters bolster or heal their allies and use battlefield to their advantage. Position support monsters just behind a front line of melee-focused monsters or next to artillery, and use them to sustain allies with their powers. Assign at least one supporting ability for this monster regardless of its trait."],
    ["Defender", "<strong>Defender</strong> monsters have more defense but less damage. They specialize in drawing the PCs attacks and protecting other monsters. Use defenders in an encounter to keep the PCs in place, preventing them from attacking the artillery, controller or support monsters behind the defenders or chasing after the assassins."],
    ["Solo", "<strong>Solo</strong> monsters have much more hit points and damage. They are specifically designed to appear as single opponents against a group of PCs and function, in effect, as a group of monsters. A solo monster might have tendencies that flavor it toward the brute, defender, assassin, artillery or controller role. Every solo monster has to be able to stand and fight on its own."]
