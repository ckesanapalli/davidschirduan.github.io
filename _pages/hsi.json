   "Adventurers": {
     "Charlie (Thief)":"A young thief with sandy blond hair and brown eyes who seeks the “Luck Jewel” and, hopefully, his fortune. Wears a light-brown shirt, loose blue pants, an oversized black leather belt, and wields a dagger. His ship crashed off the coast of Hot Springs Island when another adventurer beat the helmsman with an oar. Fearing for his life, Charlie leaped overboard and swam ashore. He recently evaded capture by a group of ogres, and his only bag is full of whale meat that never spoils.",
     "Joni (Ranger)":"A young archer with sandy- blonde hair and blue eyes, accompanied by a few friends to find her missing younger brother, Charlie. They secured passage by hiring on to protect Jack the Jeweler, who hopes to find a magical forge rumored to be on Hot Springs Island. Joni wields a horn longbow and shortsword and has the capability (unbeknownst to her) to befriend coppermane prowlers.",
     "Bryan (Cleric)":"A close family friend of Joni and Charlie. He is middle-aged, with hazel eyes and graying hair he wears in a pageboy haircut. He retired from adventuring to run an orphanage years ago, but when Joni sought help to find her missing brother, he gladly suited up once more. Bryan wields a blessed war mace he calls Justice, in addition to his faith.",
     "Trevor (Fighter)":"A longtime friend of Charlie’s who worked as a caravan guard for many years. He has brown hair and eyes, and wears a matching steel helm and breastplate. Trevor was the first person to tell Charlie the legends of the Luck Jewel, and when Joni told him Charlie had gone missing to find it, his guilt compelled him to join up. He normally wields an axe and shield, but is skilled with polearms.",
     "Ada (Wizard)":"A supremely skilled evoker, and Joni and Charlie’s first cousin. Ada has dark eyes, and braids up her black hair with small silver chains. She wears the blue sash and purple robes of her order, and if her spells fail, she wields a quarterstaff of enchanted holly.",
     "Jack the Jeweler (Thief)":"Light-fingered and known the world over for his quality crafting and whimsical jewelry designs, Jack was personally invited to the islands by Jeremy Rand’s adventurers guild. Before heading to Rand’s Retreat, he recruited a party of adventurers to recover a small mystical forge rumored to be on Hot Springs Island. Jack has wavy red hair, green eyes, and usually dresses in bright greens and yellows. He normally lets his bodyguard Audrey fight for him, but his daggers and poisons are lethal in a pinch.",
     "Eunice (Wizard)":"A petite wizard of wealth and repute, convinced to fund an expedition to Hot Springs Island by her lover, Jack the Jeweler. She wears a large brown floppy hat with matching robes and slippers, and keeps her short hair tucked behind her ears to show her golden eyes. Jack promised she could keep the forge and return to her tower if she doesn’t like the Swordfish Islands, but she knows better than to put too much stock in his word. She hopes to use the forge to make a perfectly spherical and reusable heart for a terracotta golem design she has been working on. Eunice makes clever use of illusions to confuse her opponents before blasting them away with a chain lightning spell of her own design.",
     "Audrey (Fighter)":"Jack the Jeweler’s bodyguard. Audrey is over six feet tall, with long black hair she normally wears in a tight ponytail. Muscles ripple beneath her smooth olive skin, and her attire of light armor and loose pantaloons is well suited for tropical climes. She believes Jack’s decision to visit Hot Springs Island is a mistake, but she’s the first to admit that she’s paid for her fighting skills, not her opinions. She is terrifyingly good with twin shortswords, and occasionally breaks out a small crossbow when the situation calls for it.",
     "Baxter (Thief)":"A skilled thief and learned scholar who uses his knowledge of the past to locate big scores. Baxter has deep ebony skin, hazel eyes, and always wears a surprisingly clean red shirt. His research and inquiries with Martel Company contacts confirmed the existence of a mystical jewelers forge in the elven ruins on Hot Springs [HS-19]. He sold this knowledge to his old friend Jack, but demanded to come along for the adventure too. Baxter is rarely caught off guard, and works tirelessly to identify all the angles in a situation. He prefers to fight with gadgets of his own construction, such as a wrist-mounted crossbow, blinding powder, poisoned darts, and anesthetic- injecting daggers.",
     "Benedict (Fighter/Thief)—Pirates":"A sailor by trade, Benedict was marooned on Hot Springs Island several months ago after leading a failed mutiny. He is a stout man, bald, but with a thick red beard and hair all over his body. His shirt wore out long ago, and all he wears now are a tattered pair of blue-and-white striped pantaloons held up by a red sash. He is skilled at catching boars and using dripping trees defensively. He even survived a couple of Arva attacks using his wits and cutlass. Benedict has discovered the location of kujibirds [HS-18- 03], but he doesn’t realize how valuable this information would be to the blue-scaled Kiru.",
     "Alphonse (Thief)—Pirates":"Well into his seventies, Alphonse does not look a day over thirty. He has shaggy blond hair, tanned skin, and milky blue eyes, and wears rags insufficient to cover his decency. A crazy hermit, he has survived on Hot Springs Island for almost fifty years. Once a dashing young cutthroat, he sailed with the Adder—a legendary and insane pirate captain who possessed an elixir that unnaturally extended his life. But one night, after witnessing the extent of his captain’s madness, Alphonse grabbed a jug of the legendary potion and jumped ship in the Swordfish Islands. He is so convinced the Adder will find and kill him that he has gone insane, raving about it constantly. Alphonse guards his jug of longevity juice jealously, but five doses (one per year) remain.",
     "Horatio (Thief)—Martel Company":"A Martel Company acquisitions specialist sent to Hot Springs Island to retrieve an important shipment stolen by an ex-marine (Travis). He has brown hair, green eyes, and wears piecemeal leather armor with a dark-green bandana around his neck. His informants believe a rogue trader will pick up the stolen shipment at the next full moon, and he hopes to find the thief long before then. Though Horatio normally works alone, he is a pleasant individual and will accept help or offer his services to others if their goals align. He wields a pair of custom enchanted shortswords with slots in the blade that can catch and break the swords of his adversaries.",
     "Travis (Fighter)—Ex-Martel Company":"Once a ranking marine with the Martel Company, Travis led a successful mutiny against a company ship, killed the captain, and stole several important pieces of magical apparatus from its cargo. He rowed them ashore to Hot Springs Island, where he has arrangements to meet a rogue trader at the next full moon. Travis wears a blue-and-white bandana to cover his bald head, and a standard-issue Martel Company outfit, complete with saffron jacket, because he forgot to steal new clothes. He fights with a harpoon and a silvered sword, and is terrified of the creatures on the island. No one warned him how dangerous it was, and he plans to double his price for the merch once the trader shows up.",
     "Ruben (Fighter)—Martel Company":"A Martel Company marine shipwrecked when the civilian transport he was guarding got caught in a storm off Hot Springs Island. He is young and strong, with wavy black hair, a patchy beard, and brown eyes. The only survivor he found was Benjamin, but they salvaged a good deal of supplies and shelter in the wreck on the beach. Ruben wields a cutlass with a broken tip, has a few throwing daggers, and hopes to pay for safe passage off island for himself and Benjamin with rum and a small chest of gold jewelry. Each night, Ruben builds a large bonfire to signal for help, but it’s only a matter of time before it attracts Arva.",
     "Benjamin (Fighter)—Martel Company":"A hired blade running from his past. Benjamin has light-brown skin, black hair, dark eyes, and the remains of a well-groomed mustache about to be swallowed in a shipwreck beard. He wears a fine scale mail tunic that is clearly missing a chest insignia for a holy order. Years ago, Benjamin was forsaken by his order and blamed for crimes he did not commit. He regrets not fighting for his innocence, but felt honor-bound to cover for his mentor as the scandal broke. With nowhere to go and a past to escape, he hired on with the Martel Company. After the shipwreck, he and Ruben developed an intense bond and became lovers. Ben has begun to wonder if maybe this was part of his god’s plan all along, and has begun work on a small shrine as his faith rejuvenates. He wields a scimitar and buckler, and with his extensive knowledge of plants, he can heal most ailments with something from his bag of dried herbs.",
     "Claire (Wizard)":"The first apprentice to a powerful wizard flung to Hot Springs Island when her spell was interrupted by witch hunters. Claire has platinum-blonde hair, green eyes, and a terrible sunburn that her tattered blue-gray robe and floppy green palm-frond hat do little to prevent. She was attempting to summon a creature to protect herself and her master from witch hunters, but Neville (one of those hunters) disturbed her in the spell’s final moments. When the two were flung to this remote place, they were forced to overcome their differences in order to survive—and after a series of adventures, have fallen in love. In addition to an exceptional intellect, Claire wields an ancient elven spell book she found in the ruins [HS-19] and a slim metal wand of lightning.",
     "Neville (Fighter)":"Oldest son of an ancient family of witch hunters. Neville was part of an expedition to kill Claire’s arcane master, but during the battle, he disrupted her spell and they both wound up on Hot Springs Island. He has chestnut-colored skin and smooth, black, shoulder-length hair. His clothes and armor were once bright red, but they are stained and streaked with mud. He has come to love and respect Claire deeply during their time on the island, and never wants to go back home. Svarku has been trying to recruit Neville to kill an Ash Baron, but he doesn’t think the efreet’s offer is sweet enough. Neville is terrifying with a spear, and he currently wields a golden Fuegonaut model with a superheated head.",
     "Tabitha (Monk)":"A monk attempting to find true solitude. Tabitha’s skin is a rich chocolate brown, and she decorates her braided hair with large beads and thick coatings of red clay. She wears lose-fitting flowered robes of rusty brown and spends about 60 percent of each day in meditation. She holds her body in special poses of her own design and faces the sun throughout the duration of her meditation. Her inner peace and self control are such that small objects within ten feet of Tabitha levitate a few inches off the ground around her. During her time on the island, she has become aware of the ongoing conflict between Molotek and the serpent at the heart of the world (p. 68), and wonders if she might help. If she must fight, Tabitha prefers to use heavy clubs that trees will gift her from their heartwood.",
     "Jenny (Fighter)—Martel Company":"A beautiful young cook on a Martel merchant ship marooned on Hot Springs Island after rebuffing her captain’s advances. She has dark skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes. She was wounded by a boar shortly after arriving, and her cream- colored blouse is ripped and bloodstained. Jenny has taken shelter in a large tree, but her untreated wounds leave her weaker every day.",
     "Ivan Blackhand (Fighter)—Martel Company":"A former marine separated from his company during a Fuegonaut ambush. He has dark hair and heavy bags under blue eyes. He wears a chain shirt over a sleeveless leather tunic, and the veins in his hands and feet are visibly black. He recently took shelter in a ruined elven building where a partially functioning singing golem served him food and sipopa (p. 147). Ivan has no idea what the “thick orange drink” was, but he liked it enough to steal a small barrel. He wields a saber and dagger in combat.",
     "Gretchen (Wizard)":"A powerful hydromancer drawn to Hot Springs Island due to legends of mythical aquifers. Gretchen has red hair and blue eyes that are hardly ever seen, as she dresses in robes and veils of dark green set with crystals on tinkling chains. An adjunct professor at the Royal College of Banuvo, she had secured a number of grants for what she hoped would be groundbreaking research. Unfortunately, her first drill hole unleashed a torrent of crystalback wydarr and her party was slaughtered. Not content to simply survive, Gretchen maps springs on the island and knows the complete lay of the land in d4 hexes. The nereid Daphne (p. 125) has begun to secretly observe Gretchen, and plans to enlist her aid if she proves to be a true water friend. Gretchen wields an enchanted staff with crystal inlays, and she suspends herself from the branches of a tree in an orb of water to sleep.",
     "Wild Eye (Barbarian)":"A barbarian with no memory of how she came to be on Hot Springs Island. Wild Eye may have little knowledge of the Common Tongue, but she is a killer through and through. She wears little more than rags with hide wraps on her feet, but has made a magnificent cloak of feathers from the birds and coppermane prowlers of the island. Half of one eye is bright blue and the rest is golden brown. A crystal frog lives in a tiny green pouch she wears around her neck on a braided leather cord, and it sings sweetly to her every night. Wild eye trusts few, and fights with a wooden club and obsidian dagger.",
     "Marcia (Fighter)":"A skilled warrior who once commanded an army of five thousand. Marcia has a heavy build, brown eyes, and a mane of black hair. She wears a set of steel-and-leather armor, and wields a large two-handed axe she calls Bloodfiend. Her forces lost an important battle, so she took a break from the postwar political fallout and returned to her roots as an adventurer. She heard that ogres on an island far to the south were skilled smiths, so she hopped on a Martel Company ship to acquire one of their gleaming black axes.",
     "Ulysses (Fighter)":"The only survivor of a group that came to Hot Springs Island to find living statues made of gold. Ulysses wears a steel breastplate over studded leather armor, and has black hair and noble features. In the ruins of Hot Springs City [HS-19], spiders (actually astral spinners) appeared from nowhere to wrap up and eat his party. Ulysses was wrapped up, too, but his enchanted sword and martial prowess saved his hide once again. He managed to recover the map the party leader had been following, and he plans to hunt the statues once he figures out how to get off the island. Ulysses fights with an enchanted long sword that grows hotter and hotter the more he fights with it.",
     "Dale (Cleric)":"The only survivor of a group that came to Hot Springs Island in search of riches. Dale is tall and muscular, with dark skin and light eyes. He wears a heavy chain shirt over a ripped orange tunic, and defends himself with prayer and a blessed hammer that crackles with lightning. One day near the Temple of Tranquility [HS-23-02], he stepped away from his group to relieve himself. When he returned, his friends had vanished without a trace. After a fruitless week-long search, he built a small shelter and shrine to his god, where he prays daily. Dale’s companions were slaughtered by a band of Arva, and steam imps decided it would be fun to hide all traces of the combat and bet on his reactions. He has proven supremely interesting (three imps lost their cores when he built a permanent structure), and if he can make it a few more weeks, the imps plan to help him out.",
     "Luther (Sorcerer)":"A powerful sorcerer from a distant land, banished to the Swordfish Islands to die. Luther single-handedly slaughtered every member of a noble family using his dark magic, but was betrayed and captured. The wizards who captured him could not kill him directly, so they slapped him in rune-scribed metal bracers that cover his forearms, then teleported him away. The bracers limit Luther’s magical abilities to cantrips, and they are lined with spikes so that a slow drip of blood leaves him constantly red-handed. He has sworn eternal vengeance upon the fools who let him live, and he seeks new fools to free him. Luther is large and balding, with pale dead eyes and an unkempt beard. He wears ragged black robes of once-fine material and is incredibly skilled with a sling.",
     "Jus (Druid)":"A flock of starlings came to Jus as he wandered the wetlands of his homeland, telling him of a dying dryad trapped on an island half a world away. He left immediately, and now wanders the jungles of Hot Springs Island seeking the dryad whom nature called him to find [HS-15-02]. Jus is a large, jolly man who wears a robe of living woven blindfire vine. He speaks to the animals and laughs with the trees. Even though he has a deeper connection to nature than to his fellow people, he is kind hearted and always offers a warm smile and a helping hand. Jus wields a gnarled staff of ash and calls upon nature for aid in combat.",
     "Sssa (Ranger)—Kiru":"A Kiru ranger who has come to Hot Springs Island to hunt the mythical kujibird. Sssa’s scales are a deep midnight blue, and he wears nothing but a bright-yellow loincloth and a shell necklace. He dreamed he would find the birds in a cave with crystals that glow like the sun [HS-22-01], so he fearlessly enters every cave he finds. Sssa fights with a bow and a wicked obsidian blade, and he can make almost any tool he needs within twenty minutes.",
     "Horoch (Ranger)—Kiru":"Horoch was spirit- bonded to his childhood rival, the Kiru ranger Jola, and the two were sent to Hot Springs Island to overcome their personal differences. Unable to overcome his resentment, Horoch murdered Jola as he slept in the ruins of Hot Springs City [HS-19]. He has light-blue scales and wears a necklace of bright-red feathers that once belonged to Jola. Knowing he can never return home and feeling nothing but emptiness and hatred, Horoch has begun stalking a group of Arva and is trying to work up the courage to ask if he can join their ranks.",
     "Six (Steam Imp)":"Six the steam imp has only two miniscule fragments of his elemental core left, and he rubs them between his fingers constantly. His skin is a smoky blue-gray and most of his left ear is gone, leaving only a few ragged tatters attached to his head. The only rule steam imps have is that you must always make good on your bets. However, when Six was faced with losing his core, he ran for his life. He is terribly depressed as he wanders the island muttering, “But I didn’t lose... that wasn’t the wager.” He will forever worship anyone who can get him back in with the steam imps, or find him the six steam cores he now owes the House (p. 138).",
     "Golok (Ogre Bonebinder)—Night Axe":"Golok, also called Gold Bone, travels across the island collecting bones for his spells. He wears large gold rings in his ears and nose, and four of the large bones on his necklace have been coated in gold. He actively seeks adventurers and offers them gold dust in exchange for salamander bones (particularly vertebrae). He wields obsidian daggers and always has 3d6+3 enchanted bones on his person.",
     "Bokel (Ogre Edgesworn)—Night Axe":"Bokel fights like a small army was melded into one being, and is becoming one of Mog’ok’s favorite Night Axe. He walks through the jungles naked but for two crossed hide bandoleers to hold his backup obsidian blades. He prefers to be alone, and feels called to seek out the remains of fallen Night Axe to give them proper burials.",
     "Orrin (Ogre “Sage”)—Night Axe":"The Night Axe ogre who calls himself Orrin found an enchanted circlet of black metal set with a large sapphire in a pirate dugout on Hot Springs Island. The circlet granted him the ability to speak, read, write, and understand all known languages. After experiencing this awakening, he renamed himself Orrin, wove a kilt of leaves and grass, and began painting his large stomach with blue swirls every morning. He made the dugout his new home and has begun stealing all the books and writing supplies he can get his hands on. Orrin has fashioned a makeshift writing desk and is working on his magnum opus detailing the struggles of the Night Axe. It has just passed five hundred pages in length, and he likes to joke that now that he’s completed the first 90 percent of his book, it’s time to begin the next 90 percent.",
     "Bamvo (Ogre Warrior)—Night Axe":"Bamvo is one of the youngest Night Axe ogres, and he believes that Glavrok does not respect him because of his youth. The truth is that Bamvo is not ready to become an edgesworn, and Glavrok knows he will not pass the test. Unable to accept this, Bamvo stole a number of powerful items and headed out to kill Svarku himself. He is trying to find a secret way into the efreet’s lair that will bypass most of the Fuegonauts. Bamvo wears a stolen boar headdress, bleached whalebone shin- and armguards, and two enchanted obsidian-tipped spears.",
     "Zulok (Ogre Bonebinder)—Night Axe":"Zulok, a particularly emaciated bonebinder, recently lost an eye to the Fuegonauts and gained a scar from forehead to mouth. In the unconsciousness that followed, he saw a vision of an artifact that could aid his people. It resembles a statue of a woman, hidden in a magnificent structure filled with pools and strange people [HS-19-01]. Zulok fights with a curved staff adorned with enchanted bones, trinkets, and the core of his bonded water elemental.",
     "Rocky (Combustarino)—Fuegonauts":"Rocky lost his special insignia and butterfly blade during a skirmish with the Night Axe at the Scorched Earth [HS-12-01]. It now hangs atop Glavrok’s South Watch [HS-12-02] with other Night Axe trophies. Right after Rocky became a combustarino, Svarku publicly praised his insignia, and now the imp feels he must retrieve it before returning to the volcano. Svarku has no memory of this event.",
     "Skletch (Salamander Trickster)—Fuegonauts":"Skletch is normally found along the coast, carrying or eating swordfish. Several months ago, he killed a group of adventurers cooking a swordfish in their camp and became hooked on the flavor with his first bite. After realizing this delicious food came from the sea, Skletch crafted tentacle rings that would protect him from the cold and wet, and decided to become a fisher. His light-blue scales and white underbelly gave him excellent camouflage in the ocean, and he has taken to swimming more and more. He hunts swordfish with a golden spear custom-made for the job.",
     "Fruss (Salamander Warrior)—Fuegonauts":"Fruss granted himself a leave of absence from the Fuegonauts and decided to explore Hot Springs Island. Or that’s what he tells people. In truth, he lost a bet with a steam imp over some underground fire imp fights in Crystalflow Mine (p. 70), and has been in hiding ever since. Luckily for him, he found an old pirate dugout filled with spiced rum, so his temporary exile has been quite pleasant. Fruss’s scales are a deep red-orange and he wears broken porcelain doll heads on his face tentacles. He fights with a golden spear and three-pointed dagger, and is deathly afraid of fog, mist, and clouds.",
     "Jelex (Salamander Trickster)—Fuegonauts":"Jelex is so disappointed with Svarku. When she first came to Hot Springs Island, she was enamored with the charismatic efreet, but her infatuation has cooled with his dithering. Svarku has lost his way. He has forgotten what all creatures of fire know: that the cold, wet worlds in the void of the physical plane exist solely to be burned. But Jelex has not forgotten, for she is the conduit of fire! She recently started a secret group to further her ends, and has even attempted to recruit mortals to the cause. Jelex has white scales that blaze like a magnesium flare, and has pierced her back spines with heavy gold hoops.",
     "Felor and Blix (Salamanders)—Fuegonauts":"The twin salamanders Felor and Blix are identical in every way but color. Felor’s scales are a light orange, whereas Blix is the blue of burning gas. They eat together, sleep together, go everywhere together, finish each other’s sentences, and are a huge thorn in Svarku’s side. The twins delight in pain, death, and fire, and have ruined a number of the efreet’s plans with their actions. They enjoy kidnapping solitary Night Axe and taking them to a collapsed lava tube near the coast. Once there, they use bladed golden gloves to flay and then eat their captive alive. The twins have also begun selling red crystal dust to other salamanders, and to undermine Svarku’s new moon parties (p. 65) by hosting their own on the same night."

   "Sulfo’s Dirty Journal":"A small notebook of drawings. It mostly contains crude pictures of salamanders in suggestive poses and piles of gooey eggs, but occasionally notes Fuegonaut patrol schedules and locations.",
   "Skull of Tom McCray":"A humanoid skull carved with elemental runes. Ever since he was a little boy, Tom wanted to become a floating flaming skull when he died. A salamander trickster told him he could make that happen, but instead, it forced the skull—and Tom’s lingering intelligence—to answer any question it hears with a mockingly incorrect reply. Tom’s skull can shoot a 10’ jet of blue-hot fire from its eye sockets each day, but only for people Tom likes.",
   "Tito’s Lost Insignia":"A combustarino’s insignia—a gold plate set with red crystal in geometric patterns. Always hot enough to ignite paper or cloth. Engraved with the name Tito.",

   "Pickpocket’s Hand":"A twitching humanoid hand attached to a 10’ braided leather cord. If not kept in a dark place, the hand attempts to pick pockets as if it were a high-level thief.

   "Blooming Flute":"A polished wooden flute carved with winged serpents. Any song of moderate difficulty played well on the flute causes all plants within 20’ to bloom.",
   "Blooming Snake":"A snake made of wood and flowering moss. When discovered, it looks dead and brittle.

It requires daily attention (water, sunlight, love; and it enjoys music), or its flowers wither and die. Once “dead,” the snake can be rejuvenated only by another person.",
   "Blooming Transplanter’s Pot":"A planters pot of transparent obsidian. If the pot is filled with dirt and planted with a single seed, it will grow a seedling ready for transplanting in 24 hours. Flowering plants never lose their blooms while in the pot.",

Anyone wearing a bracelet can feel what others wearing the bracelets are currently feeling with their hands.

   "Cape of Fratricide":"A small cape of silvery snake scales.

   "Crystal Snake Spike":"A 1’ stylized snake statue carved from a single piece of crystal. Its head is bent forward and its body is straight like a tent stake. Inserting the statue in the ground overnight cleanses the area within a 20’ radius. This cleansing removes anything that would hinder the growth of plants, and piles those impurities neatly along the edge of the effect.",
   "Drain Pipe":"A 25’ hollow vine with rubbery walls, and one end that resembles roots. The roots dig in if placed on soil, and after a time, water flows from the tube. If there is any fresh water in the world, it will eventually be drawn to this vine. Skilled users can target water sources and relocate them, given enough time.",
   "Drum of the Harvest":"A polished wooden drum carved with strange fruits. Well-played rhythms of moderate difficulty cause all flowering plants within 20’ to produce seeds or fruit.",

   "Finder Snake":"A 3” mithral spike is topped with a ring shaped like a serpent eating its tail. Holding the ring allows the user to recall the last one hundred inanimate objects the spike was double tapped against. The memories enter the mind in a rush, causing an unskilled user to be temporarily overwhelmed. If a skilled user focuses on one object, the spike gently tugs in the direction of the object’s location.",

   "Grass Bedroll":"A simple but well crafted 7’ x 4’ bedroll of sweet-smelling grass. It is worn and comfortable, but will not fall apart. If the bedroll is placed on soil and a creature near death lays upon it, the body will be pushed 6’ down into the earth (or until it hits something). The process takes about 15 minutes, and all that remains is an empty grass bedroll on the ground.",

   "Mithral Mask":"A serpentine mask mosaicked in obsidian and mithral, and set with two large fangs. Clearly designed for a nonhuman face.",
   "Mithral Mirror":"Solid mithral, engraved with scales.",
   "Moonshard":"This translucent stone of milky blue the size of a human thumb radiates such old magic that even non-magic users can feel it.

The moonshard stays aloft for 1 hour, and floats along with its user if the moon likes them.",
   "Mosquito Pot":"An elaborate, chipped terracotta decanter partially covered with growths of sickly looking purple fungus.

   "Obsidian Sipopa Flower":"Exquisitely carved and delicate, but breaks only against basalt. It can float on water and is light enough to be carried away by a strong wind.",
   "Once More":"A large serpentine skull etched with ancient runes and missing its lower jaw. The runes seem to spell out gibberish except above the eye sockets, where they read: “Once more.” This was once the skull of a powerful agrimancer (a farm wizard) whose spirit lingers. If the spirit detects a potentially sympathetic individual, it communicates with them telepathically. The spirit is friendly and sincere, and has a tremendous knowledge of plant and animal husbandry. Eventually, it will ask to possess a sympathetic owner for a year and a day. It is unclear what motivates the agrimancer, but the spirit would be happiest if confronted with a challenge like terraforming a desert.",
   "Pipes of Floral Attraction":"A set of wooden panpipes bound with green twine. Playing these pipes causes nearby plants to turn toward the player as if they were the sun.",

The basket contains three wooden trays divided into forty-five slots. Plant or insect specimens enter a timeless stasis while in a slot. d20+4 of the slots are filled.",
   "Spit Snake":"A detailed 1.5’ resin snake engraved with the word “spit” in ancient runes. A creature that spits on the snake can control it as a real snake for 1 hour per day. All the snake’s senses transfer to the user, and other animals treat it like a real snake.",

   "Red Scale Boots":"This pair of giant red-orange salamander-scale boots is thickly lined with silver hair. The wearer can step on lava to cause it to solidify. Ogres dislike the boots, however, as they must move much slower than normal to cool enough lava to support their weight.",
   "Bone Mallet of Straight Flight":"A heavy mallet of bone and 3d20 pencil-shaped obsidian spikes. Hitting the back of a spike shoots it forward in a perfectly straight line for 100’.",
   "Redball":"A crude wooden bucket is covered by a leather flap held shut with an obsidian toggle. When opened, a glowing orb of colored light shoots out and flies to a random location 1 mile away, where it remains for 1 hour or until touched by an intelligent creature. Touching the orb causes the creature’s hand to glow that color for 1 hour or until the hand is inserted into the bucket. Up to eight different colored orbs can be released, but the first is always red. This game is most frequently played by edgesworn.",
   "Rockcracker":"The large, rippled molar of a broadback is affixed to the end of this 3.5’ club of heavy black wood. Once per day, it can be used to shatter massive stone walls or boulders with ease. The tooth cracks when the stone does, but the molar slowly repairs itself over 24 hours. Once the crack is no longer visible, it is ready to strike a mighty blow again.",
   "Runed Bird Skull Helm":"The skull of a duecadre is decorated with bright-yellow feathers and fitted with a chinstrap of braided silver hair. The skull’s eye sockets glow with dark energy, and in times of extreme duress when physical strength is needed, the hair of the straps grows down along the back of the wearer’s arms and legs. This grants the strength of two ogres, like an exoskeleton of silver hair and dark magic.",
   "Runed Bird Skull Pauldron":"The skull of a coppermane prowler is etched with sparking runes and fitted with straps like a pauldron. Small arcs of electricity dance across the wearer’s torso, giving the protective equivalent of leather armor.

There is also a 30 percent chance that the electricity from the skull stops the heart of anyone who wears it for the first time.",
   "Runed Bone Haft":"A 4’ axe haft of rune-scribed bone. Slamming it against stone causes it to grow or retract a razor-sharp obsidian axe blade.",

   "Silver Hair Belt":"An ogre-sized belt made of tightly braided silver hair. Six obsidian meat hooks are woven into the belt, one of which impales a pair of salamander feet. If the severed feet of an enemy are impaled on a hook for a day and a night, the feet can walk to one requested location visited by their previous owner.",
   "Silver Sack of Nuggets":"A small sack of woven silver hair decorated with twelve jeweled rings. The pouch is closely guarded by bonebinders and brought out only to settle negotiations or Night Axe debts with scummy adventurers. The sack always contains twenty gold nuggets of various sizes—but once removed, those nuggets transform into chunks of feces in 3 days.",
   "Silver Tongue Skull":"A salamander skull is etched with crude runes, a cord of braided silver hair running through the eye and nose sockets. If the skull is pointed toward salamanders, it acts as an interpreter between them and the user. While it does so, the braid of silver hair flaps and grows. If the hair touches the ground, the skull belches black smoke and shatters.",
   "Silversight Hood":"An ogre-sized hood of burlap is adorned with obsidian beads, and a curtain of silver hair hides the wearer’s face. In darkness, the wearer can see as if by starlight, but any light greater than candlelight is blinding.",
   "Silverzip Bola":"A bola of three blackened zip bird skulls and cords of braided silver hair. Entangled targets are lifted 10’ into the air and held upside down for 4 hours.",
   "Singing Rope":"A 1’ leaf-shaped piece of obsidian is tied to the end of a 12’ long cord of tightly braided silver hair. When spun horizontally, the rope emits an eerie multiphonic scream. Night Axe women play a game in which one spins the rope, chants in a fast rhythm, and begins standing and squatting. Other females approach and attempt to match the chant and movements. The first ogre then passes the spinning singing rope to another, who must keep it spinning and start a new chant, while all others move away to begin again.",
   "Slipshine Oil":"Found as d6 skins, this oil is nonflammable, noncorrosive, extremely slippery, and smells like fish.",
   "Stay Fresh Bag":"A 6’ sack of whale leather with no seams and a drawstring closure keeps food fresh indefinitely. Contains 300 lb. of boar meat.",
   "Strap of Faces":"An 8’ leather strap is adorned with masterful bone carvings of thirty-six ogre faces, the eyes of which are set with glowing red crystal. Glavrok carved the faces, but the strap has been missing for a year. Some say it could be used to commune with Mog’ok.",
   "Training Axe":"This 8’ iron bar weighs 450 lb. but is perfectly balanced. Anyone able to lift it has visions of an ogre warrior (Srok before he lost his tongue) demonstrating two-handed axe techniques. The vision lasts 30 seconds unless each move is perfectly replicated, which causes 30 more seconds to appear. Only the best can make it through the bar’s full hour of training.",
   "War Horn of Friendship":"A war horn decorated with runes and strips of whale leather. It can be heard only by trusted friends of the sounder.",
   "Watertight Basket":"A large watertight lidded basket is made of black baleen and silver hair woven in a zigzag pattern. If the basket is placed in fire, the fire quickly goes out. If fire is placed in the basket, it explodes out like a fountain.",

   "Wind Glove":"An ogre-sized left-hand glove made of broadback hide. Anyone who puts it on finds that it fits snugly, as their hand is cushioned by air. The wearer can grab hold of the wind and jump to move along with it. It is not possible to guide the wind, but the user can jump higher or lower in the gust they are riding, and experienced users can jump between gusts.",
   "Wooden Multitool":"A 2’-long, 9”-wide log of red-hued wood is set with obsidian whorls. If it is carved into a functional tool, that tool has the properties of steel. Can be recarved each day.",
   "Barb of the Ethereal Ray":"A 2’ barbed spike of mithral appears to have come from a stingray. Holding the barb calms emotions and aids rational thought, but triggers feelings in the holder that they should stab the barb into their heart. If they give in to these urges, the spike turns ethereal as it stabs, and a great ethereal stingray judges the wielder’s heart. If the ray determines the wielder is decent, it bonds with them for a year and a day. If it determines they are evil, the spike instantly changes back into mithral once embedded. Bonded users can place the barb in their heart four times per day to have the ethereal ray fly them to a destination up to 1 hour away.",
   "Bellvia’s Gift":"This stylish porcelain teacup and saucer will not break if dropped. Pouring water from the cup into the saucer enables the user to scry any location where there is water, as long as the user has touched that water before. An inscription once covered the bottom of the saucer, but only “Love, Bellvia” remains.",
   "Black Coral Oar":"This 7’ staff of polished black coral resembles an oar, being perfectly straight and flaring out like fan coral at one end. Skilled users can weaken or strengthen currents, create a strong wave, or propel small water vessels at 5 times their normal speed.",
   "Bladed Flute of the Waves":"An edgeless knife of silver is shaped like low waves and colored with a gradient of oxidation. Holes enable skilled musicians to play the blade like a flute, but nereids can use it like a high-powered water jet capable of cutting through steel up to 6” thick.",
   "Brooch of Patronage":"A brooch of twisted and spiraled platinum set with sapphires allows free movement and breathing underwater to one who wears it. Only twenty are known to exist, given as gifts to early patrons of Meltalia and the Fifty Visions. Nereids likely treat anyone wearing the brooch with extreme suspicion.",
   "Calcified Turtle Eggs":"In the long-forgotten past, a great war was fought on the plane of water. The forces of water won, but their losses were great. Also great was their anger at all the watery creatures who could have fought with them but did not, so they cursed those creatures and bound them into turtle eggs. A water friend can throw one such egg into water to hatch a giant aquatic creature that must aid the user for a day and a night to regain its freedom. The creature is random but defined by d4 of the following aspects: 1. Teeth 2. Tentacles 3. Toxic 4. Bioluminescent 5. Terrible Beauty 6. Swarm 7. Pincers 8. Mammal",
   "Circlet of Allegorical Sight":"A delicate-looking circlet grown from branching golden coral. With 1 hour of meditation, the user can see glimpses of the future for a specific person, place, or thing. These glimpses are presented allegorically, however, using animals in farmyard settings. For example, an ogre wondering if a dangerous mission will be a success might see a cat being eaten by four rats in a vegetable garden.",
   "Circlet of Anemones":"A circlet of polished white coral adorned with small pink and white sea anemones. Words spoken within 50’ sound half as loud as normal as the anemones catch and eat them, analyzing these words and passing their opinion to the wearer. They are excellent at catching truth, lies, and distortion, but terrible with jokes and sarcasm.",
   "Comet Loop":"This 18” gold chain has a sparkling orb at each end resembling a comet. The orbs lock together, and if the resulting circle is spun underwater, it can be used to scry.",
   "Conch of Many Sounds":"A conch horn carved to resemble a hexagonal mesh and dipped in silver. It can sound like any wind instrument the user can clearly visualize. Though these conches were created for the Fifty Visions’ performances, they have more recently been used to replicate gigantic war horns and pipe organs.",
   "Coral Salt Bowl":"A bowl of polished black coral. If filled with seawater overnight, it will be filled with 1 lb. of salt in the morning.",
   "Coral Starfish Brooches":"A pair of pink coral brooches masterfully carved in the shape of starfish are adorned with a large gold eye on their undersides.

   "Crystal Canteen":"A small but heavy canteen of cut crystal. A nereid or other water elemental can fit comfortably within and not evaporate.",
   "Crystal Claw of Regeneration":"A 6” crystal crab claw can regrow a lost body part in 1 week if attached to the stump. Single use.",

   "Freezing Starfish":"A set of twelve glass starfish the size of a thumb. Each one has eight arms and is colored with swirls of blue, gray, or fuchsia. If placed into water, the twelve link up to form a circle. All water within the circle and in a 1’ cylinder below is purified and then chilled to temperatures well below freezing. This process takes about 5 minutes.",
   "Glass Sea Apple and Black Mesh Veil":"An almost spherical, organic-looking fist-sized lump of brightly colored flesh resembles a pomegranate, but is covered in swirls of lilac and blue, and lines of tiny yellow nubs. If a glass sea apple is removed from water and left in a dry place, it extrudes feathery glass tentacles that vibrate at an ultrasonic frequency. Some call this vibration a song, and if a special veil of black mesh is worn, the user has a three- dimensional view of anything within 50’ of the apple. Glass sea apples dry out completely in 48 hours, but if they are kept in water when not in use and fed regularly, they can live for years. Small animals behave erratically in the presence of the glass apples’ ultrasonic frequencies.",
   "Gown of Aquatic Temperament":"An exotically cut, form-fitting gown covered in silver sequins. The sequins—as well as any body of water the wearer is standing in—undulate in a way that matches the wearer’s mood. Enough rage can whip up a tempest, but the constant chop of cheerfulness can be dangerous in its own right.",
   "Jar of Octopi":"A jar filled with seawater and eight golf-ball-sized octopi. Swallowing an octopus whole enables the user to comfortably survive in any environment for 30 days. Nothing about this boon feels temporary.",
   "Lightbloom Anklet":"An anklet of small polished seashells on a chain of silver. When worn, any water touched by the anklet glows with light that blossoms outward from the wearer. The color of the light matches the wearer’s mood, with deep purple tied to anger and happiness tied to pure white.",

   "Quick-Release Cuffs of Choreography":"These heavy silver cuffs resemble shackles. They have no keyholes, but putting pressure in the right spot pops them open in a way any performer will immediately recognize. The cuffs are frequently found in sets of d6+2, with everyone wearing them able to flawlessly copy the movements of the first person to put them on. Meltalia’s Fifty Visions would use the cuffs to change up their routines nightly, but these days, they are most often used to create lethally synced melee combat teams.",
   "Red Coral Harp":"A hand harp of polished red coral strung with black and gold. Requires no tuning, and can be heard 1 mile away underwater.",
   "Ring of Coral Armor":"A ring of rough red coral. If its wearer is about to be struck by a weapon, red coral sprouts from their skin to block or catch the blow. This effect can occur d4+1 times per day, with the coral covering the entire area that would have been hit. The user must eat an extra pound of food for each such growth, which remains on the user for 7 days before sloughing off. Coral growths will rip through clothing and armor to block incoming attacks.",
   "Sea Turtle Rings":"These seven silver rings are engraved with scenes of sea turtles. If a nereid wears two of the rings, anyone wearing the other five will be able to breathe and move freely underwater within 20’ of the nereid.",
   "Seahorse Ring":"A heavy gold ring in the shape of a perfectly detailed seahorse. If worn for a full lunar cycle, it gives birth to a clutch of d20+4 tiny seahorse rings in various metals. If the baby rings are left in salt water for a week, they grow into full-sized rings.",

   "Seaweed of Enchantment":"A bundle of wet seaweed held together by an ivory ribbon. When touched by anyone with a command of enchantment magic, the seaweed transforms into a resilient 7’ staff. As a staff, it improves the wielder’s enchantment-based magic by 50 percent (effect, duration, targets, and so forth), but no heat-related magic can be cast.",

   "Unborn Dryad":"A globe of water 8” in diameter contains an oak sapling. The globe feels wet to the touch but does not burst unless it is placed on fertile soil, whereupon the oak within takes root and grows at 10 times the normal rate. After 10 years, the tree will birth a dryad.",
   "Silk Mask":"This 2’ square of white silk always appears wet but leaves moisture only on skin. If worn as a mask over the nose and mouth, the wearer can take on the full physical appearance of anyone they wish. They must have a clear mental image of the person, and the ruse can be used for 1 hour each day and night.",
   "Silver Dolphin Nose Clamp":"A silver nose clamp engraved with dolphins. Its wearer can swim effortlessly underwater, jump up to 25’ out of the water, and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. Frequent use causes the wearer to require four times as much food each day, and gives them a taste for fresh, raw seafood.",
   "Speech Fish":"A tiny, bright-orange dried fish with large eyes. Swallowing it whole enables the user to speak and understand any language until the fish passes through their system. Nereids can kiss the fish to gain its benefits for 1 hour. Holding the fish gives one a sense of being on the cusp of a brilliant idea that never comes.",

   "Starfish Climbers":"This pair of hand-sized metallic purple starfish are so well crafted that they appear to be alive. Their tiny feet grip any surface with extreme suction. This can cause severe hemorrhaging if attached to fleshy creatures, but they’re great for climbing sheer surfaces or holding on in turbulence.",
   "Stingray Bracelets":"A set of five bracelets made from stingray hide are dyed a bright white and closed with a silver star clip. If no clothing or armor is worn (weapons and jewelry are fine), the bracelet enables its wearer to breathe underwater, swim effortlessly, and comfortably survive in temperatures up to –20° F.",
   "Sunbeam Spotlight":"This bracelet of translucent blue resin glows softly and is pleasantly warm to the touch. Its magic functions only during the day, and during that time, tiny sunbeams drift slowly through the resin. If the wearer is submerged in water, they can spin the bracelet to have a sunbeam illuminate them like a spotlight, no matter how far beneath the waves or how deep underground they are. The wearer can also grab the beam and pull it along as they move. Up to 6 sunbeams can be active at a time, and they last until sunset or until they are dismissed.",
   "The Fifty-One Tears":"A necklace of fifty-one flawless pear-shaped diamonds on platinum chains resembling a waterfall. This was given to Meltalia when she arrived on the Isle of Light. It is mundane but beautiful—possibly even priceless. Each time a person wears the necklace, there is a 90 percent chance they suffer terrible nightmares with themes of capture, imprisonment, or torture. However, there is also a 10 percent chance that the person has an immediate, intense vision of the capture of Meltalia, and can communicate with her for 5 minutes. If this happens, the wearer is physically incapable of removing the necklace until Meltalia is freed. The nightmares continue, and removing it by force kills the wearer.",
   "Tiny Gold Crabs":"These d6 tiny gold crabs are perfectly detailed. If placed on land, a crab quickly scuttles toward the nearest fresh water source and waits within it to be retrieved.",
   "Vial of Home":"A vial of cut crystal is etched with a symbol the nereids read as “home.” If the vial is filled with water, then poured out, the user can step into the puddle and be transported to the water source used to fill the vial. If the vial is emptied into a body of water, up to twenty individuals can be transported.",
   "Water-Friend War Horn":"This giant spiraled shell horn has a shining gold mouthpiece. The exterior of the horn is completely covered in barnacles. Blowing the horn underwater generates a tremendously loud sound that can be heard for 2 miles. Nereids, water elementals, and other water friends can hear the sound up to 100 miles away, and will interpret it to mean that the elemental forces of water are under attack by another element and losing.",
   "Watery Gown":"A dressing gown of sheer silver fabric dyed with streaks and swirls of dark blue. It keeps its wearer protected from the effects of heat, no matter how severe. There were originally fifty matching gowns, but many were destroyed when the Fifty Visions were captured. Most of the remainder have been brought to Svarku’s harem (p. 64), and the efreet will pay handsomely for any others that can be found.",
   "Barren Mother":"A fist-sized terracotta statue of a naked, weeping pregnant elf. If it is gifted to a woman who has borne no children, she becomes barren. If it is gifted to a pregnant woman, she will miscarry before the sun sets.",
   "Bexzeel’s Core":"A simple but finely crafted leather pouch contains the elemental core of a steam imp and a note that reads “Bexzeel the magnificent, never lost a bet.” The pouch stops the reformation of any elemental whose core it holds. Bexzeel was tricked by elves who cheat, and his skills and notoriety make this core priceless to denizens of his home plane.",
   "Blank Crimson Tome":"A hardbound tome of crimson leather bound with a platinum clasp. The pages are empty, but if the book is held and the phrase “I demand [book name]” is spoken, it will fill with a copy of the book demanded.",
   "Book of the Lost Boy":"A book with a porpoise- skin cover and gold-leaf pages. Beautiful illustrations animate to act out each scene of the story of a boy lost in the woods.",
   "Box of Bladed Scars":"An ornate gold box engraved with scenes of nude figures in martial combat, all of which have a distinctive spiral tattoo on their forearms. The box contains six belt-sized strips of fresh, bloody skin branded with Elvish runes. Two say ‘longsword.’ Two say ‘shortsword.’ Two say ‘dagger.’ If a strip is held, it starts to move toward the holder’s dominant forearm. If not stopped, it spirals around the arm, fuses to the flesh, and turns bright orange. Once the strip is fused, a flick of the wrist places its named weapon in the dominant hand. The weapons are silver, and phase out of existence after 10 minutes of inactivity.",
   "Catfish Helm":"A catfish-shaped mithral helm with long gold whiskers and two large eyes. It amplifies all water-based magic by 10 percent to 25 percent. Each opalescent eye is half of the core of a powerful water elemental, whose pieces are kept apart by the helm’s potent magic. If freed, it demands to be called Flourish but immediately swears to help its emancipator accomplish any three tasks that will advance the cause of water on this plane.",
   "Codpiece of Sustenance":"A highly exaggerated silver codpiece engraved with a scene of a waterfall. Its wearer does not need to eat, drink, sleep, or excrete waste. However, the leather straps holding the piece are always just a little too tight to be comfortable, and the device stops functioning if covered by clothing.",
   "Crystal Romance":"A 1’ hexagonal rod of violet crystal. Elvish runes spell out “Light my fire” along one side. Speaking the phrase causes the rod to explode into nondamaging fragments that become scented candles when they land. In the presence of sexual climax, the candles give a brief but extravagant fireworks display.",
   "Cubic Focus of Shame":"A seamless, unbreakable 2” glass cube appears to contain twenty-seven cut diamonds of exceptional quality. A spellcaster can use the cube to cast spells without expending their own energy. However, this triggers deepening feelings of shame, regret, and guilt. After five uses, the despair can cripple even a person of strong will for d4 days. After ten uses, the cube winks out of existence and reappears elsewhere.",
   "Daphnee’s Vambrace":"A delicate, decorative gold gauntlet. Any articles of clothing (but not jewelry) touched by the gauntlet are consumed and stored. If the wearer says “clothe me,” the gauntlet dresses them in something fresh and stylish. Up to 65 tons of clothing can be stored this way. The glove can also spew forth a torrent of clothing the wearer has stored but which is now considered outdated. Once expelled, the gauntlet refuses to store those clothes again, for its wearer’s own good.",
   "Decadence and Greed":"A pair of masterfully crafted fighting knives engraved with Elvish runes. One has a thick straight blade, while the other has a thin curved one. They do double damage against magical creatures and elves. The blades were crafted and used by an elven serial killer who would preach against corruption and excess during the day, then kill “sinners” at night. The blades vibrate in the presence of anyone who has accepted a bribe.",
   "Decanter of Tears":"A sapphire decanter shaped like a tear drop can pour forth 20 gallons of salty water a day. This water is the tears shed by the widows and mothers of those killed in battle.",
   "Diamond Harp":"A hand harp carved from a single diamond and strung with astral silver. “Play” is carved along its base, and causes the harp to play beautiful music if spoken.",
   "Druidic Robes":"A large leather map case is embossed with fighting stags in a forested scene and sealed with translucent amber wax. The case contains a fine set of robes embroidered with Elvish and elemental runes. Normally green and white, they shift to match the colors of natural surroundings if the wearer keeps still for 10 minutes. The robes amplify the effects of any nature magic by 10 percent.",
   "Dvorak’s Songbird":"A small windup nightingale of astral silver. Once wound, the bird flies in an outward spiral to a distance of 20’, singing sweetly. All but the winder must save or fall asleep.",
   "Embroidered Bloodcoat":"A slender, short coat of pure white with geometric red embroidery on the cuffs. The coat never dirties, but as fresh blood is spilled upon it, the embroidery grows and expands. The coat cannot be removed until it is completely covered in red, which normally takes about ten humanoids’ worth of blood.",
   "Euphoric Top":"A 3” toy top of purple crystal. Anyone who spins the top is filled with euphoria and dizziness of the best kind. The “high” dies down as the spin does. Nonaddictive. Probably.",
   "Gaudy Purple Hat of Obscurity":"A gaudy, wide-brimmed hat of thick purple leather is decorated with green, yellow, and pink lace. Remaining motionless for 15 minutes renders the wearer unnoticeable until they make any sudden movement. Hiding for too long might attract mischievous extradimensional creatures.",
   "Gavel of Agreement":"This oversized ivory gavel has a gold and silver head. It sounds ten times louder than any normal gavel when struck, and any who hear it are inclined to agree with anything the “judge” says for 10 seconds.",
   "Gold Faceball":"A smooth sphere of gold about the size of a human head. When it is held with both hands, a face extrudes from the sphere and acts randomly (roll d6): 1. The face yells the holder’s deepest, darkest, most scandalous secret. 2–5. The face vomits forth a cloud of 100 translucent, iridescent butterflies. 6. The face yells the deepest, darkest, most scandalous secret of the holder’s sworn social enemy. For a time, this was an exceptionally popular game on the Isle of Light.",
   "Ornamental Shortsword":"Made of gold and onyx, this shortsword looks like two highly stylized, entangled birds. Their crossed feet decorate the hilt, and their wings form the cross guard and ornamental blade.",
   "Pipe Bombs":"A polished wooden box with velvet lining holds six glass pipes. The clear glass of the pipes contains free-floating metallic specks of color that drift and swirl constantly. Any smokable substance put into the pipe ignites immediately. The pipes do not break if dropped, but if they are purposefully thrown or crushed, they explode like a couple of fireballs.",
   "Gold Glasses of Flesh":"Eyeglasses with polished disks of gold in place of lenses. When worn, a person’s vision functions normally, but all humanoids appear completely nude except for their weapons, which are clearly visible.",
   "Honeypot of Hallucination":"A glass jar decorated with tiny platinum bees holds a platinum honeycomb-shaped dipper. Any honey placed in the jar becomes highly hallucinogenic. Whoever holds the dipper can guide the hallucinations of all who have eaten the honey.",
   "Iron Satyr":"A 6” iron sculpture of a satyr with a large erection and a large grin. Its arms are outstretched and hold a bowl engraved with the words “GIEF GOLD.” If gold is placed in the bowl, the statue turns red hot, melts the gold, drinks it, and then acts randomly (roll d4): 1. The satyr masturbates to golden completion. 2. It sings a lewd song about a fisher, her husband the whale, and her lover the octopus. 3. It bends over and recites a random filthy limerick from its butthole. 4. It spews the most masterful string of profanity for 5 minutes straight.",
   "Lover’s Mirror":"A golden clamshell opens to reveal a hand mirror opposite a concave slot. If a token of true affection is placed in the slot, the gifter can be scried in the mirror.",
   "Lucid Dreamer’s Blackout Bag":"This hood of fine silver mesh has no face hole, and is easily mistaken for a bag. Its wearer believes they are in a candy forest that the evil sun threatens to melt. The wearer’s body goes limp (as if asleep), and the hood cannot be removed unless another pulls it off (1 hour of disorientation follows), the wearer defeats the sun, or the wearer realizes they are dreaming.",
   "Mirror of Assets":"An oval hand mirror of astral silver is surrounded by stylized vines and six jeweled sipopa flowers. Touching a flower shows a current view of a set location. Only three are currently set—a sunken house, the Copper Arch [HS-23-03], and the sky.",
   "Moaning Chime Holders":"A bundle of eight capped 1’ tubes of pinkish leather, d6+1 of which hold a random chime (p. 149–150). Chimes cannot be removed except by fondling the tube’s opening. When a chime is inserted or removed, the case emits a soft but audible moan.",
   "Monkey Phones":"A set of two hand-sized monkey statues, expertly carved from wood that is fuzzy to the touch. One is seated, its mouth open as if laughing. The other is stretched out, mouth open as if yawning. Both statues’ right ears are large and exaggerated. Speaking into the ear of one statue causes the other to repeat the words it hears in loud, ancient Elvish. The statues function within 1 mile of each other.",
   "Nonstick Chain":"A 2’ chain of gold, platinum, and pink metal has sharp-toothed alligator clamps at either end. Nothing sticks to the chain, which does not tarnish. The clamps can be released only by the person who applied them.",
   "Orgy-in-a-Bag":"A large green leather satchel is completely embossed with scenes of an elven orgy. It contains six thick 1’ pink candles that smell of musk. When lit, the candles produce a pinkish haze and do not melt. After 5 minutes, the haze from one candle fills a 10’ x 10’ area like a slow smoke bomb. Prolonged exposure to the smoke leads to a pleasant but persistent arousal, a hatred of clothing, and... well...",
   "Portable Platinum Puddle Bag":"A small sack of ultrafine woven platinum wire is decorated with tiny glass bubbles. Anyone with a natural affinity for magic can reach into the sack and pull out a sphere of pure water 2” in diameter. The water stays together as a gently swirling orb until placed in a living creature’s mouth (where it is instantly absorbed) or until thrown or crushed. The orbs can normally withstand being dropped 10’ to 20’ without bursting.",
   "Provocateur’s Belly Chain":"A platinum belly chain adorned with diamonds and small dangling bells every inch. Increases the wearer’s agility and enables them to flawlessly execute three new, highly provocative dances.",
   "Quill of Automatic Records":"A bone quill inlaid with geometric gold patterns.

Too much speech can heat the quill to the point where it ignites the paper it writes on.",

   "Sensitivity Gloves":"Translucent white gloves. Increase the wearer’s sense of touch tenfold.",

   "Starry Cigarette Holder":"A long cigarette holder made of crystallized void swirls with tiny galaxies and is capped in gold. When placed in the mouth, a lit cigarette appears. It is doubtful that the user has ever tasted finer tobacco, but the cigarettes are impossible to remove.",
   "Stormgasm Medallion":"A palm-sized gold medallion depicts an elven orgy aboard a ship in calm seas, with storm clouds in the distance. Holding the medallion causes extreme arousal upon boarding a ship, and a 100’ bubble of fair weather and calm seas surrounds and follows the item. If the medallion changes hands, or if its possessor has an orgasm, the bubble pops and normal weather rushes in to fill the void. It takes 5 minutes for the medallion to reactivate. For a time, these medallions were part of a popular game. Elves would sail pleasure yachts into dangerous reefs and conjure up a storm. The team with the most orgasms and the least damage to its yacht won.",
   "Sweetest Sound Earrings":"A pair of large pearl earrings set in platinum magically adhere to the ears of anyone who tries them on, even without piercing or clasps. Their wearer hears all negative sounds as their positive opposites, and all words are distorted so as to stroke the wearer’s ego.",

To the right of the mill, in a small clearing, the nereid Elorinth is being burned at the stake while figures in strange robes look on. The foliage in the painting changes with each season to resemble spring, summer, autumn and winter.",

   "Vinlay’s Catalogue":"A 6’ x 4’ standing mirror shows anyone standing before it stripped of their normal clothes and dressed in what was once the latest elven fashion. It cycles through seventy-five androgynous looks. Large Elvish runes say “Property of Vinlay’s” on the back.",
   "Voyeur Ring":"A platinum ring set with a large emerald resizes itself to fit anyone perfectly. The wearer can choose to mark anyone they shake hands with.

   "Yellow Glove of Desire":"A left-handed glove of bright-yellow velvet, made to cover only the back of the hand, part of the palm, and the thumb, index, and pinky finger. It fits anyone who tries it on. Anyone repeatedly touched by the glove becomes utterly fixated on pleasure.",
   "Yvelia’s Bloom Kit":"A 3’ x 2’ rosewood case is inset with the name “Yvelia” in gold Elvish runes. The kit holds a hand spade, pruning shears, and a half-filled jar of fuzzy white orbs. Plants (except trees) in areas dug by the spade grow to maturity in one lunar cycle. Blooms cut with the shears regrow on their parent plant overnight (but plants die after d4+1 clippings). If a white orb is placed on soil, it grows four spindly legs and can move as fast as a cockroach. Yvelia used the fuzzballs to collect seeds, but they can be ordered to collect any small plant life within 100’ of their master. After completing its mission, a fuzzball dies, but planting one with the spade yields 3d6 more.",
   "Zeb’s Lost Coin Collection":"A solid, rectangular tile (1’ x 2’ x 3”) of hard, seamless clear material. Five rows of eight coins are evenly spaced throughout. “Zeb” is etched on the edge of the tile. Each coin is of a different mint, shape and material. The languages on the coins are esoteric and extradimensional and they appear to be worth a considerable amount wherever it is they originated.",
   "Arva—Bag of Eyes":"A translucent, lumpy red membrane is stitched with sinew to form a pouch, and holds 2d10+3 humanoid eyeballs with the optic nerve still attached. If an eye is removed from the pouch, it orbits the user’s head for d10+10 minutes, observes from the perspective of that type of humanoid, and relays that information immediately. The eyes are typically used for translation purposes, and read lips flawlessly. Advanced users can suss out motivations from cultural clues and body language. The magic is in the pouch, and new eyes are empowered after 24 hours.",
   "Arva—Cavalry Stick":"This 6” obsidian tube is decorated with tiny infernal runes. Anyone holding the stick except those of truest heart feels the urge to break it, and strongly believes that doing so will be beneficial. Breaking a stick notifies its Arva creator and tags the breaker with an easily tracked infernal aura for 3 days.",
   "Arva—Flask of Purification":"A small metal flask covered in tiger-striped leather. One drop from the flask can completely purify a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ volume of stagnant water. However, any intelligent creature drinking from this source is marked with an easily tracked infernal aura for 3 days.",
   "Arva—Glove of First Impressions":"A large fingerless glove of coppermane prowler hide, decorated with tiny infernal runes and broken prowler feathers. Anyone touched by the wearer receives an electric shock that grows in intensity each second. The glove can identify how much charge would stop its victim’s heart, and always pulls back just before that point.",
   "Arva—Hunter’s Headdress":"Once this was the headdress of a Kiru shaman. Its feathers have been smeared with blood and feces, and decorated with at least fifteen strips of blue- and green-scaled flesh branded with infernal runes. Its wearer can immediately sense all life larger than a sparrow within half a mile. The rush of information is initially overwhelming, but after a month of constant use, the wearer can pinpoint the location of specific individuals. Removing the headdress, even for a second, restarts this process. Each strip of flesh comes from an individual Kiru or Goa who was killed, desecrated, and then consumed by the maker. As such, non-Arva lizardmen usually attack the wearer of such an abomination on sight.",
   "Arva—Juniper Juice":"A wooden jug, corked with bone, that feels like ice to good-natured people. Each drink tastes like the imbiber’s favorite flavor and refreshes as completely as a good night’s sleep. The aftertaste, however, triggers feelings of intense shame and makes a person more susceptible to suggestion.",
   "Arva—Purple Swashbuckler’s Hat":"This bright purple hat has a white plume and a bright-pink sash. Its interior is tiger-striped orange and black silk. Anyone wearing the hat cannot be directly harmed by any Arva, but the wearer can feel a set of predatory eyes looking at the back of their neck (Damadar, p. 142).",
   "Arva—Shrapnel Spears":"A sheepskin quiver is painted with swirling black designs that slowly move, and holds twelve thin javelins with heads of obsidian on a small steel spike. Impact causes the glass to shatter. In addition to causing grievous wounds, Arva often throw shrapnel spears at the ground for a caltrop-like effect.",
   "Arva—The Gentleman’s Blade":"A beautifully crafted 43” steel-basket rapier has a blood-red gem for its pommel. In the hands of a good person, any attack that lands will always be the most excessive, over-the-top, gory wound possible. A hit that should have been a scratch becomes an artery gushing blood or a skewered limb. In the hands of the brutishly evil, the blade is dull and the hilt pinches. In the hands of a purely self-serving person, it is a powerful magical sword, capable of piercing most anything and landing a flurry of critical blows.",
   "Arva—Trap Kit":"A broadback hide sack contains three spiked leg-hold traps of rusted steel, four 30’-long wire snares, and a leather cuff. Half the cuff is covered in red beads, and half in black. Touching the red rapidly opens and closes the traps. Touching the black electrifies the wire snares. Both effects transfer a small amount of life force from the victim to the user. This transfer is highly addictive.",
   "Goa—Auto Hammock":"A 10’ x 6’ canvas, soft but rough looking, with small mithral chains on each corner. It can hang itself on any nearby supports to form a hammock, tarp, or platform that supports the weight of three humans.",

   "Goa—Duecadre Tongue Sponges":"A cloth sack containing 3d6+1 rune-scribed duecadre tongues. These act as super sponges, one of which can absorb an entire barrel of most liquids (notably blood and booze). A filled tongue is the size and weight of a human arm.",

   "Goa—Hurricane Wraps":"A pair of 30” strips of coarse, dark-blue burlap are decorated with mithral raindrops and embroidered with “run” and “water” in lizardman runes. Wrapping them around an arm or leg enables the wearer to run across the surface of water like a waterspout. Does not work at speeds slower than a jog.",

If the snake’s tail is held and its head is thrown toward a target, the mouth opens to grab it. The snake can stretch up to 48’ and support the weight of six humans.",
   "Goa—Shimmershift Blade":"An obsidian throwing knife in a vine-embossed fuchsia scabbard. If it is thrown and embeds in anything, it quickly reappears within the scabbard. The blade does not break unless it strikes basalt, which shatters it into glittering shrapnel.",
   "Goa—Sleeping Salve":"A fine wooden container, 4” in diameter with a screw-top lid, contains lime-green salve smelling strongly of bergamot. If applied to an open wound that is then bandaged, the wounded creature falls into an unwakable 4-hour sleep. Upon awakening, the wound will be fully healed. The salve does not mend broken bones, but it regrows scales.",
   "Goa—Stay Fresh Satchel":"A large gray satchel of broadback hide has a wooden toggle. The inside is lined with soft, silvery fungus that constantly emits sweet-smelling purple spores. Meat placed in the bag is kept fresh indefinitely.",

   "Goa—Unbreakable Bow Drill":"A bow drill with four sizes of mithral bits that never dull or break.",
   "Goa—Vest of Refreshment":"This leather vest of broadback hide is decorated with coppermane prowler feathers. When at the brink of physical exhaustion, the wearer can remain still and hold their breath for 10 seconds to become completely revitalized and refreshed. When this occurs, the coppermane prowler feathers discharge a small burst of electricity in a 5’ radius. This can be done only once per week. Attempting to use the vest’s powers more frequently causes a handful of feathers to fall off and decreases its effectiveness.",
   "Goa—Water Extractor":"A translucent red vyderac feeder sac is adorned with a mithral lizardman “W” rune. Any water scooped into the sac is purified in 4 hours. The process starts immediately, and anything not water oozes out of the rune. It can even be used to extract water from things like blood or beer. Goa legend says that an ooze imp was placed into an extractor once, and after a day and a night, a water imp was found in the bag and an earth imp outside it, but this has never been replicated.",
   "Goa—Zoom Reed":"A hollow reed, 3/4” thick and 1’ long. A small mithral rod runs down its length, causing it to function as a spyglass. If the reed breaks, the rod can confer its powers on another tube of similar shape.",
   "Kiru—Ancestral Orbs":"A fine wooden box carved with a funerary scene contains four rune-scribed 3” orbs of wood, obsidian, basalt, and mithral. Once per week, a person attuned to the orbs can roll them across a patch of ground open to the sky, and ask their ancestors about a current problem. Any ancestors that have an opinion for their descendant speak their mind. If not, the orbs roll back to the box.",
   "Kiru—Beaded Will":"A small bag containing 127 fingernail-sized, rune-marked beads of wood, obsidian, mithral, and red crystal. The bag also contains a wooden square with five hooks on one side, and the name “Hessru” on the other. Hessru was a ranger of renown on Southspire Island, and these beads are his last will and testament. Any Kiru recognizes this immediately, but only their shamans know the rituals to spell out the bead’s various messages.",
   "Kiru—Blowgun and Darts":"A small hide pouch trimmed in mithral beads contains a blowgun, 2d6 darts, and a miniature self-sustaining terrarium with a violet poison dart frog.",
   "Kiru—Bluescale Rope":"This 1/4” rope is 100’ long and covered in blue snake scales. It supports 2 tons and never causes friction burn.",
   "Kiru—Bug Blaster":"A thick glass lens 4” in diameter with a scaled mithral handle. Bugs and parasites glow when viewed through this lens, and scales become invisible. If paired with a light source, the lens emits a heat beam of bug death, able to vaporize bugs up to the size of a human thumb in about 10 seconds.",
   "Kiru—Cloak of Light and Shadow":"A large, roughly woven, hooded cape in a black and white zigzag pattern. If its wearer remains perfectly still for 1 minute, the pattern shifts to match the light and shadow of its surroundings. Requires at least partial sunlight to function.",
   "Kiru—Cloth of Aversion":"A 2’ square of silk-like cloth, as black as the void of space, that never dirties. A crude orange sludge has been rendered at its center, but it’s hard to tell whether it’s painted on or is part of the cloth. Orange sludges actively avoid (but don’t ignore) its wearer.",
   "Kiru—Fletcher’s Kit":"This fletcher’s kit contains all the tools necessary to make arrows from scratch. This includes one bag of uncut white zip bird feathers and a smaller bag of cut green feathers that have been coated with green dart frog poison. It also contains d12 blunt obsidian arrowheads that burst on impact.",
   "Kiru—Focused Filter":"A round 1’ sieve made of mithral and ultrafine iridescent cloth. If the user sweeps it through any sort of liquid or gritty solid (water, lava, dirt, sand, and so forth) while concentrating on something, the sieve only catches the objects sought. All other material passes through. Things can only be caught if they are actually there. For example, the cloth cannot be used to sieve for gold in a stream where no gold is found.",
   "Kiru—Junk and an Antidote":"A hide pouch decorated with red crystal mushroom-shaped beads. Contains six saltwater crocodile teeth and twenty-four dried mushroom caps that counteract dart frog poison (except green).",
   "Kiru—Leash of Companionship":"This 4’ leash of embossed leather and mithral can expand to fit any unintelligent animal. Any animal wearing the leash becomes loyal to the user—bonded for life after a week and a day, even if the collar is later removed. The bond breaks (badly) if the master uses the leash on another animal.",
   "Kiru—Magma Imp Helm":"A half-burned burlap sack contains the elaborate helm of a magma imp, but large enough to fit a humanoid. Wearing it enables one to comfortably survive in extremely hot environments and splash about in the hottest water. The helm was given to the Kiru shaman Golthax before he was murdered by Fuegonauts. All magma imps instantly recognize their crafting, and are exceptionally displeased to see it worn by any but Golthax.",
   "Kiru—Minimap":"A rolled 2’ x 2’ hide map is held closed by a red crystal ring. The map updates when unrolled to show a rough 2-square-mile area centered on the user. Sources of fresh water and food (tailored to the species of the user) are marked on the map.",
   "Kiru—Mood Changer":"A small tambourine with mithral cymbals that makes no noise. However, if wielded by a skilled musician, it can shift the mood of an audience to match the musician’s.",
   "Kiru—Moss Poncho":"A woven poncho covered in a patchwork of at least twenty types of moss. Under the light of a full moon, tiny silver mushrooms sprout and spew iridescent spores just before dawn. Anyone within 10’ of the poncho is healed of most physical, mental, or spiritual afflictions if they inhale the spores. It can bloom d4+1 times before withering.",
   "Kiru—Muzzle of Sustenance":"A leather muzzle for a snouted creature. Embossed with a bound lizardman, it morphs to fit anyone. The wearer cannot speak, but does not need to eat or drink.",
   "Kiru—Pinion of Understanding":"A 1’ white feather, partially dipped in silver paint, glows in the moonlight. Wearing the feather allows the user to understand the language of the Kiru.",
   "Kiru—Wood-Friend Pitons":"Two obsidian pitons are driven into a block of wood. Removing them leaves no holes behind, and they can be securely embedded into any wood without damaging it.",
   "Kiru—Zip Bird Call":"A palm-sized terracotta whistle shaped like an O. It perfectly imitates the “woop” call of a zip bird, and if blown three times in quick succession, has a 65 percent chance to attract any zip birds within a half mile."

 "Rumors": [
   "Immortals have no ghosts; they simply attenuate with age. The silver shapes inside the mist are the still-living remnants of that people.","There was a population explosion at some point, but the new buildings were badly made and decayed fast. So remember, if it’s ruined, it’s new. If it seems in good condition, it’s old.","Water shadows in the pools at dawn bring stilled fish to the hunting gray herons that were born from their songs long ago.","The elves’ tombs are invisible whorls of silence beneath impossibly balanced stones. The only treasure there is peace.","Their silver is unloosed in time. If you steal it, invisible spirits carry you instantly into the past, where you are tried, sentenced, and imprisoned. On your release, you are carried back to the exact time and place you left, aged twenty years and traumatized. Wizened victims attest to this.","There are hidden messages in abandoned places many hundreds of years old. They claim to be from people escaped from imprisonment in the ancient past, but they have modern names. Some sound like those who have just arrived on the island.","The moon was a member of the royal family. They traced their descent from the moon, and hollow thrones were built to hold its image in the sky. Moonlight serves them still.","Enemies of the state were cursed into the forms of black panthers with golden claws and teeth, then set to guard the island’s secret paths. If a panther ignores its duty, its teeth and claws soften like real gold, and it starves to death. Some still guard the ways.","They taught the birds to sing laws and legends as a living library. If you spend an hour every morning for a week meditating on birdsong in the same place, you can decipher fragments of corroded elven lore in the song.","They were corrupt, and the criminal underclass smoked drugs purified from the ground-up brains of poisoned dwarves. They still haunt the ruins of slums as highly specific, low-level junkie wraiths.","Monkeys around the hot springs were trained as butlers. If you encounter them, you might find yourself trailed by packs of wild monkeys that insist on carrying your bags and compulsively toweling you down, and which attack if not tipped.","Working-class elves in the Petalled Age used normal keys that function as ours do. They were so ashamed that they made them look like tuning forks that sound when struck. Such locks never guard treasure because those elves were poor, but they can open utility spaces.","In the First Age, criminals wore chains of gold with single links of iron. In the Petalled Age, the jails and chains went unused. But the shackles are still there.","Some of the island’s reefs are bone piles encrusted with coral growth. Smash them, and the piled-up bones of elven children slither into the sea.","The volcano didn’t break through the stone cap the elves made. It was released at the climax of a titanic and decadent concert. Nearby civilizations record the low-frequency vibrations of that day from a thousand miles away.","Elves gave their voices to the tide. If you address a whitecap of the sea with the correct name, it speaks. But watch the time; the tide is coming in.","If you dig into the mud floors of the lower baths, you find finger bones. Lots of them.","The older baths and pools higher up the volcano have straight-edged geometrical shapes. Shadows don’t like to go there. Only a few remain intact.","The volcano is a sonic lock—the biggest one on the island. You just need the right sounds to set it off. It all makes sense! The island is a door, and they tried to open it! Listen to me!","Musical instruments were banned during the Petalled Age as tools of theft. Elves found singing were drowned. Except pregnant women—they had to sing.","If you leave logs overnight and the natives take a chew on them, sometimes the chew marks look like letters from the Elvish language.","All the kids went into the sea, and the women went into the fire, and the men just ran around fucking and killing each other until angry ghosts finished them off. It’s true—a lizard told me. Yes, it was in a dream! Look, I’m not the one spends his off-hours talking to a fucking frog!","If you make pipes from a comrade’s bones and play music on it, the shadows will dance and caper as long as you play. They kill you afterwards, anyway. Because I played till dawn, that’s how I know! I played till dawn!","The language changes halfway through. The letters are the same but the words are different, and nothing written in the language mentions it or says why.","The old buildings are built by elementals and for elementals and with elementals. It’s why everything makes sense. It’s all triangles and squares and rings and things. Then they just went away...","If a woman gives birth on that island, all that comes out of her is dead flowers and thorns. They don’t live through it. Oh no? Then why does nothing decent settle there? It’s petals and thorns, and it tears ’em right up.","If you speak the elf tongue out in the forest, birds go silent for a mile around, like the world’s biggest hawk just flew by. They’re scared of nothing else.","They’re not shadows; they’re just veiled. That’s what she did for them. She put veils over those terrible things so they could act with them like people. If you saw the real thing straight on, it would burn you up inside.","Some of the very old statues are of stags and bears and animals you don’t find here. But they’re all together in big houses, like museums.","They made the moon their queen and commanded the tide to cough up foundations for a great city. Well, the sea gave it to them. Then they forgot their queen, and the tide took back in an hour what it took centuries to build.","It’s all supernatural claptrap. If a society of immortals starts having lots of kids on an isolated island—well, that writes its own story, doesn’t it? Do the maths.","Look, if you base your economy on songs, mint currency from moonlight, and build your banks out of bells, frankly, you deserve whatever happens to you.","There are too many predators around here. What are they all eating? It doesn’t make sense. It’s like someone’s giving away free meat whenever we’re not around.","The water in the remaining pools reflects sunlight in the day and starlight at night, but never the moon. Like it isn’t there.","You never see a really pretty female statue, do you? Not one of the naked ones. It’s because they’ve had their faces and their tits and their parts smashed in. You check. It ain’t time that did that.","All those carved wreaths are code. Each flower means something, and read together, they make a language. But we’ll never work it out. Wreaths are poems, gardens are songs, and short, sharp bunches are threats.","It was a woman who started it all, they say. She came from somewhere else, a criminal. They threw her in the volcano, she came rising back up one day on pale roses of flame. That’s when it started to change.","How can an elf get old? They live forever, right? But you see ’em in those paintings, though, in the crowds, right at the back, on their own. Old elves.","They thought glass caught memory like the shadow of a murder on the wall. That’s why you never see glass in the windows. It’s not smashed; they removed it and hid it all somewhere. If you find that glass, you’ll know their secrets.","We caught one of our lads wanking on one of those dirty-necked statues. We hid, were gonna jump out on him as he finished up to teach him a lesson. But then the statue moved!","Whoever they were, they never got bored of porn. My lads are sailors, and even they got tired of those frescoes after a while.","Every statue is carved looking at another statue. If there’s a wall between them, it looks through the walls like they’re not there. If you follow the eyeline, you’ll find another one eventually—even if you move ’em!","You can tell when someone’s been too long in the ruins, because their eyes start reflecting a flame that isn’t there.","They say nothing survived the fall, but I reckon there were gangs living as scavengers in the ruins till they died out. Just a handful, like.","Those chimes are the stolen voices of singing slaves.","I’ve seen cages in the children’s bedrooms, and they weren’t for animals.","There are overgrown gardens out there in the jungle. Well, they’re not gardens—they’re camps. Fences made from sleeping lily, salt vine, constrictor vine, and rusted iron. Watchtower trees in the center, and bonepits of wet, crawling undead.","I reckon they knew society was going to go bad somehow. That’s why they damaged time around a few sacred things. So nothing could touch them. But they live forever, so it’s not like the next generation was going to go bad. It’s the same people. So it must have been inside them all along. Like an addiction you know will never go away.","No one ever says how the elves got here to begin with, or why. This whole culture was like rehab for immortals. It was meant to get them clean of something. It failed.","Out there in the harbour where the shoreline used to be, about eight fathoms down, you can see a golden bell shining when the sun hits it at noon. Folk used to dive for it, but whenever you touch it, it swings, and whatever sound it makes down there summons every shark in a hundred miles. Thousands of them, like they’ve been trained. Ships have been lost, and now captains ban diving for the golden bell.","If a golem follows you and you make for the ship, it walks down the ruined street and into the sea like it isn’t there. Then it follows the plans of empty roads and stands under the ship, ten fathoms down and looking up. But they won’t go beyond the sunken town.","I’ve seen lines of skeletons down there in the drowned murk under the keel. Linked by shining chains that never rust. But they’re gone when I look back.","Our old navigator could find islands by the ring of birds. Pulsing in and out fifteen miles into the sea on every side, feeding twice a day at dawn and dusk. But this island has no ring. The birds don’t leave. It’s like they’re trapped. Or hiding the place.","Some of the buildings are perverted. The rooms are painted tricks, with the real rooms hidden inside the walls. The doors are fake, fastened over solid stone but bare walls swing open when you sing. Big spaces have perspective tricks that make them seem small. Small ones have hidden reflectors and screens to make them feel big. It’s like the whole place is a trick, and it’s laughing at you.","Where the fuck are the sewers? They had to shit, didn’t they? Everything alive has to shit or die. Even elves. So where are the sewers? Are they secret? Hidden? Actually, it’s elves, so yeah, they probably are.","Elven utilities are always hidden in the most pretentious way possible. It’s why you can never find a toilet. Just find the most ridiculous and ornate piece of crap there, and start poking. Even chance it’s a toilet or a broom closet. (50 percent chance informant is an elf.)","The brooms of the elven folk are made from single hairs pulled from the heads of fair maidens of the twelfth rank. (Informant is a drunk elf explaining why they won’t clean up.)","Every dangerous plant and flower on this island is the relic of an ancient elven sin. They learned from the old ones how to make their sins grow outside their bodies. That’s where the killer greens come from.","The old men, the silver ghosts, they know secrets they’re not telling. I saw one make this map here. Led us to a bare stone, and underneath, a golden cup. Must have been there five hundred years. But all they want is off the island and never to return. If you can offer them passage, they might cough up a secret or two. How did old men get here anyway?","There’s a jewelled flower in there, hidden in a locked labyrinth under the town. It’s a foot across. I got close and saw a death of mine in every facet. It’s a trap. Avoid it. Dodged two deaths so far, though. So there’s that.","Every time they had a funeral, they had an orgy. Every time they had an orgy, they killed a few people. Every time they killed someone, they had a funeral, and that’s how it went till they were all gone. The last orgy must have been good, though.","There’s a hidden pool of eternal steam, and it’s carpeted with abandoned blades. The imps gamble on whether you’ll be boiled or sliced. If you survive, you can snatch a naked sword from the pit. They’re fucking deadly—the swords—but never let them feel sunlight or they’ll turn on you.","I saw a bronze shield for an instant, on a stand like it was art. There was a city in the shield, or a reflection of one, like tall towers reflected in clear water. It was the hour just before dawn in that place, and it wasn’t tropical like here. It was from somewhere north. The streets were dark, the sky was paling, and the light was white like weak milk, not this butter yellow.","We found this clasp in the shape of a flower. When you snap it shut, the flower blooms. When you open it, it closes. Doesn’t do anything else. Pretty, though.","If you see any children’s toys, don’t touch them. They grow spikes and climb to your face.","We found this room of whips, I don’t know where it was. I took one. I was playing with it on the shore and struck the sea. The water scarred. Like a cut that wouldn’t heal, and the tide went out a bit. I burned the whip. But what if she remembers I struck her? How do I get home?","If you look right at the top of the volcano, just as the sun comes up, there’s a spear lodged standing up at the highest point. It’s gold, and its blade burns in the fresh rays. It’s only there at dawn. I’m gonna get it!","The shadows walk around in the city under the water, as well you know. They’re down there in the sunken streets at night. Right under the ship!","If you go out into the overgrown slums and find the secret places and dig down, you can find hidden instruments carefully preserved. If you play them, silence tumbles from the strings—but different kinds of silence, like notes. They were rebels!","High-class elven writing nibs are single vampire incisors with ink running through. If you can get any back to the mainland, goth aristocrats pay big money for them. I’m actually a long- standing vampire expert, so I know.","The inner city is a star map. If you want to find your way out, learn the constellations of the elves and look up. Assuming it’s night and not cloudy. Plus, newer additions don’t follow the plan. Plus, if it’s night, you’re probably being chased by shadows, so you’ll want to take care of that. But otherwise, it works fine. Oh, and the elven constellations are lost. But I’m sure I’m right!","There are museums in there with suits of full armor made from perfect triangles of obsidian linked together. If you walk in them, the black glass makes sounds like faint chimes.","Doors carved with lilies have traps. Doors without lilies also have traps, but the ones with lilies always do.","Old Charlie Stumps found a pool of crystal koi that carved him a new leg of pearly stone. Worked fine. Course, he lost his left hand to the traps getting out of there. Then someone stole the leg. Least he can keep his nickname. ‘Charlie Pearls’ sounds bent anyway.","Captain I knew had a severed head he said was from a snake. Looked just like him, though! Kept it in a glass jar in his bedroom. Said he used it instead of a mirror, to shave. That wouldn’t work, would it?","Doctors like those black-bladed scalpels when you find ’em boxed up. Blades never get blunt. Don’t tell ’em about the stuff you always find with ’em, though. That gear ain’t for healing.","It’s the crystal you’re lookin’ for. If you’re robbin’ an apothecary’s (for instance), the stuff inside the jars is what you want. The glass ain’t nothing. But here, if you find a place, it’s the crystals in the wet stuff, gone like cloudy fruit, all in rows. Get the crystals out. That’s yer hit.","There are hidden torture rooms in the better new houses, but the doors to them have no locks. They just swing free.","If you measure the angles, the buildings never corner at 90 degrees. It’s always 92 or 93, yet they seem dead on. The buildings bulge. There’s more in there than there should be! The angles! THE ANGLES!","The elementals can’t remember what happened because of a curse. But they do in dreams. So if you catch one dreaming, pay attention. You might learn something.","They gave out statues for champion fuckers. Like ours are heroes and people from the government, theirs are all professional shaggers. Had the right idea if you ask me.","They used these bright songbirds as a message service. Sent ’em back and forth all day till they dropped dead, then stripped ’em of feathers and got more. If you find an unrotted wardrobe, it’s all feathers and silk.","If you see a ghost in a bright feathered dress, wearing a veil of smoke, don’t worry. She won’t hurt you.","There was a point just before the end when they all wore veils. Even hung them on the statues. A fashion thing? From the way they did it, it seems more like a religion thing.","Feathered clothes are wearable scrolls that sound continual low-level spells from color and sound as they move. Dance, and the spells kick into high level.","To beat the snakes, have a friend make you a strange mask and keep it secret in a box. You do the same for them. Open it, put it on with your eyes closed. Don’t look in a mirror. Wear it in the ruins. When the snakes whisper for you, you don’t recognize the face, so it has no effect. That’ll learn ’em!","There are slaved and mutilated nereids made entirely of liquid poison. They’re locked in glass jars under the town.","Every night you spend in that town, the shadows learn one syllable of your full name. When they can say your whole name, they can find you anywhere, and they’ll scream it while they hunt you.","Classy places have amazing swag, but you’ll never survive grabbing it. Aim low, just like in normal life. Go for the scraps. Let the heroes die.","When the tides are right, those Kiru lizardmen ride the waves on smooth planks of wood. They go rocketing right up the sea-facing streets and beach in the sandy plazas.","Ignore all the explorer marks for ‘safe’ or ‘dangerous.’ The first ones were legit, but then the lizardmen learned them somehow and started altering them to get people killed. Or one of us is doing it to keep their secrets.","If you see a clan mark or coat of arms with an animal that’s not from here, like a stag or bear, that’s old blood, old money, dangerous traps. Look out. Course, the nouveau riche are fucking deadly, too.","When the volcano goes off, everyone within a thousand miles will orgasm spontaneously. I read it in a book.","Don’t forget you can smash through the walls in shit houses. Saved my life more than once. Just don’t try it with stone.","If you swallow one of those peppers whole, you hallucinate the land of the dead. If you have a friend there, they can tell you the next thing that’s going to kill you, and you can avoid it. It gives you permanent ulcer, though.","There’s art that’s not ancient or decadent. Not much of it. Hidden paintings and sculptures of nature, local animals, even lizardmen and elves together. That age didn’t last long, though. A thin slice of time. If you find it, may as well leave it be. All the market wants is gold and gaudy shit. That’s where the bounty is.","The oldest temples have the skeletons of saints blocked up in the foundations. I think even the elves didn’t know about them. They’re all lich-saints, and are all that stops the island sinking into the sea under the weight of evil.","It’s not even about the elves. How did they find this place? Did they discover ruins and muse on them? And now we come. The whole island is a trap. A trap for cultures. There’s something deeply wrong here, and all the vibrant life on top is just a veil.","Once you taste danger and gold, it’s worse than any drug. Set foot on that black sand and one way or another, you won’t leave. My advice? Turn back now before it’s too late.","Actually, I was hoping you had some rumors for me. I’m new, you see. Gosh, you do look awfully tough!"
