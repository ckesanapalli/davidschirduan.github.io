A hex-mapping adventure. Light on combat, this adventure is about exploring and mapping a burning marsh.

Over the Bone Marshes, daylight is eternal. The sun rises and sets as normal, but itâ€™s constantly daytime; sun or no. For the past few weeks this scorching daylight has set the marshes ablaze.

The mage, Azimech, seeks to stop it. But before that happens she needs a safe route mapped through the burning marshes. Can you find the safe path?

## The Twist 

The inner ring of the marsh slowly rotates around the Central Spire once per day. Driven mad by the eternal daylight, a Spirit Guardian of the marshes is attempting to set things right by rotating a section of the marsh.
