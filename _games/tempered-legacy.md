Tempered Legacy is a [rogue-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) OSR framework where you are a Weapon wielded by many. Old-school adventure games are lethal by design. With this framework players maintain a sense of progression through multiple adventures, campaigns, and character deaths. It's also an easy way to connect adventures that might otherwise be in different worlds/realities. 

My wife, Lauren, and I designed it using [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) by Ben Milton. Knave is awesome because it's streamlined, simple, and compatible with a bunch of old-school RPG adventures. You should definitely got buy a copy of Knave, but with some tweaking, you could make Tempered Legacy work with any RPG system.

## Tempered Weapons

A meteor crashed near the wagon of a clever trader. She awoke from her sleep and carefully went out to investigate. When she saw the small crater made by a chunk of glowing metal she was overjoyed. Everyone knew the legends of sky-steel, and she could expect to earn its weight in gold twice over! 

After the metal cooled she bent down to pick it up and upon touching the still-warm surface she was overwhelmed with visions and memories from another world. Shocked she dropped the metal and pondered it for a long time. She retrieved a large knife and cut the metal into 100 tiny pieces. Each piece was so small that she could carry them while almost ignoring the echoing memories.

The trader sold the small chunks for a tidy profit, distributing them across the land. Smiths forged these chunks of sky-steel into great weapons of legend, never truly understanding the potential that lay deep inside each one.

You are one of those weapons, but your legend has yet to be forged.

You exist as a collection of memories: faint visions, blurry spellbooks, and echoes of previous adventures. You live only while someone wields you, and may grant your Wielder powers and abilities from your collection of stored memories.

## The Framework

Each player generates a Tempered Weapon lying on the ground in some forgotten area. The GM then describes a group of Wielders coming along and picking up the weapons.

Wielders can be heroes, thieves, lost villagers, or even a lowly goblin. They are randomly generated with their own skills, spells, and goals. Once they pick up a Tempered Weapon, they gain access to all the skills and spells stored within the Weapon. 

When a Wielder dies they drop their Weapon on the ground. The player decides what memories to store in the Weapon for the next Wielder. As Wielders fight and die the Weapon grows stronger, shaped by the player and their Wielders.

## How to Play

To play Tempered Legacy, you will need:

 - One player to be the Game Master, or GM.
 - 1-5 other players. _Tempered Legacy works suprisingly well for _[duet gaming](/david/2017/12/DuetGaming)_
 - Pencils and paper (or [character sheets](/files/temperedSheets.pdf))
 - A set of polyhedral dice (d20, d10, d8, d6)
 - A phone/tablet/computer to [generate Weapons and Wielders](/temperedgenerators).
 - A copy of [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) (or the slightly tweaked RPG system of your choice). Make sure everyone at the table understands the basic rules about saves, inventory, healing, attacking, etc.

The GM describes the adventure to the players, and places their Weapons just past the starting point. A group of Wielders stumble by and pick up them up and a new legend begins.

## Questions for the group

Some of the people I play with don't care about lore and worldbuilding; they just want to explore dungeons, solve puzzles and get loot. For groups that want more lore, you'll have to decide a few questions for yourselves:
 - Are the weapons actually sentient or are they just vessels for past memories?
 - How does holding a Weapon change the Wielder? Do they have a choice in the matter?
 - How rare are Tempered Weapons: common tools or priceless artifacts?
 - Does the Weapon remember anything else about past Wielders? Maybe they keep a list of names or fond memories stored deep within.
 - How much remains of their alien origin? Does that affect how they interact with Wielders?

## This is my Weapon. There are none like it.

Every weapon has a few characteristics that make it unique and useful.

 - **Name.** The name of the Weapon (one of them, at least).
 - **Type.** Determines the damage, size, and description of the Weapon.
 - A weapon can only store 8 **Memories** from past Wielders. Memories can be one of two things: 
    - **Temperaments** grant new abilities and talents. They are passive.
    - **Spells** always work once, then the Wielder must make a successful INT save or lose access to that spell for the rest of the day.

## Wielders are fragile but their Memories grant incredible strength.

 - **Stat Bonuses.** The [character sheet](/files/temperedSheets.pdf) explains what each Stat is used for; simply add that number to the d20 roll. 
 - **Inventory.** Wielders come with a few items already in their inventory, and may even use other weapons in addition to their Tempered Weapon.
 - **Appearance/Personality.** Some optional details to help players portray their Wielders.
 - **Spells.** Spells are written in books. Each spellbook takes up an inventory slot.
 - **Temperaments.** Temperaments not only reveal how the character perceives with the world, but it also grants some special passive abilities/talents.

## When a Wielder picks up a weapon...

1. Use the [Wielder Generator](/temperedgenerators) on your phone to make a new Wielder.
2. Copy down their details on the character sheet. _Make enough room in your inventory to store your Tempered Weapon!_
5. Your Wielder now has access to all the temperaments and spells stored in your Weapon.

## When a Wielder dies...

You may add to or replace Memories stored in your Weapon with spells or temperaments from the Wielder. _Yes, even spells! Enough magical energy is stored in Wielder memories for the Weapon to absorb the spell._

## Passage of Time

After a group dies it will probably be a while before more people come wandering by to pick up the Weapons. How long that takes can drastically affect the situation in the dungeon:

 - After **a few days** very little changes. Perishables left behind are still good.
 - After **a week or two** the perishables have spoiled, a few monsters have returned.
 - After **several months** the area has been re-populated, reset traps, repaired hazards, etc.
 - After **a year or two** most of the Weapons and valuables left behind to have been moved to another room/region.
 - After **decades** the monsters and traps have changed. Re-populate with new creatures and switch out some of the traps.
 - **Centuries, or longer**, basically a new area. This is the GM's opportunity to transition to a completely new adventure altogether. _"As aeons passed, your Weapons lay forgotten among the piles of treasure that travel between kingdoms and realities. Then, one day, you feel a new Wielder lift you from the dusty floor..."_

## Health and Hirelings

If one Wielder dies before the rest, that player just twiddles their thumbs waiting for another Wielder to come along and pick them up. That sucks. Here are a few ways to solve this issue:

 - **Hirelings.** The classic solution to deadly adventures. 8-10 characters go into a dungeon, and the players control the whole group with various mechanics and rules. When a Wielder dies, another one immediately picks up the weapon and things keep moving forward. 
 - **Health Pool.** For a more abstract solution you can combine the HP of all Wielders into a central pool. So instead of 4 characters with 5 HP each, the Group has a Health of 20. Whenever a character takes damage it comes from the shared pool, and when the pool depletes, the entire group dies at the same time, dropping their Weapons at the same time. Individual Wielders can still suffer injuries, penalties, diseases, curses, etc. But HP is treated more like group health where one when character suffers, the entire group must pick up the slack.
 - **Highlander.** When a Wielder dies, another Wielder picks up the fallen Weapon and now gains the benefits of carrying TWO Tempered Weapons. Players work together to control this Wielder, taking turns when deciding actions, or just working out disagreements with dice rolls. Eventually only one Wielder will be left carrying around a bunch of Tempered Weapons...until they too perish.
