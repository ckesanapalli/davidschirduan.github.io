Tempered Legacy is a framework for running your fantasy adventure games in a [rogue-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) way. Old-school adventure games are lethal by design. With this framework players can keep their "character" through multiple adventures, campaigns, and deaths. 

It's also an easy way to connect adventures that might otherwise be in different worlds/realities. And after a bit of playtesting, we discovered Tempered Legacy is a blast for [Duet Gaming](/david/2017/12/DuetGaming) since characters never really die, so rebalancing isn't an issue.

I designed it using [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave?affiliate_id=379088) by Ben Milton for my base mechanics. Knave is awesome because it's streamlined, simple, and compatible with a bunch of old-school RPG modules. But with some tweaking, you could make these rules work with any RPG system. 

## Tempered Weapons

Long ago a meteor crashed near the home of a poor blacksmith. Her family was poor, her house was poor, and most importantly, her craftsmanship was poor. When she discovered the meteor she used her tools to cut the strange, colorless metal into thin slivers. She sold these slivers to make ends meet, and other, more talented forges turned these slivers into weapons of legend.

You are one of those weapons, but your legend has yet to be forged.

You exist as a collection of memories: faint visions, blurry spellbooks, and echoes of previous adventures. You live only while someone wields you, and may grant your Wielder powers and abilities from your collection of memories.

**Bones break, minds snap, bodies fall, but steel remembers.** *- Armstrong Stormrend, famous Tempered Forger*

## The Framework

Each player controls a Tempered Weapon lying on the ground in some forgotten area. The GM then describes a group of Wielders discovering and equipping the weapons.

Wielders can be heroes, thieves, lost villagers, or even a lowly goblin. They are randomly generated with their own skills, spells, and goals. Once they pick up a Tempered Weapon, they gain access to all the skills and spells stored within the Weapon. Wielders can use other mundane weapons they are carrying; owning the Tempered Weapon is enough to benefit from its properties.

When a Wielder dies they drop their Weapon on the ground. The player decides what skills, spells, and memories to store in the Weapon for the next Wielder. As Wielders fight and die the Weapon grows stronger, shaped by the player and the Wielders.

This is less a set of rules, and more of a bunch of ideas and dials you can tweak and change to fit your group. 

## Questions for the group

Some of the people I play with don't care about lore and worldbuilding; they just want to explore dungeons, solve puzzles and get loot. For groups that want more lore, you'll have to decide a few questions for yourselves:
 - Are the weapons actually sentient or are they just vessels for past goals/skills/spells?
 - How does holding a Weapon change the Wielder? Do they have a choice in the matter?
 - How rare are Tempered Weapons: common tools or priceless artifacts?

## This is my Weapon. There are none like it.

Every weapon has a few characteristics that make it unique and useful.

 - **Name.** The name of the Weapon will change as it goes through Wielders.
 - **Type.** Determines the damage, size, and description of the Weapon.
 - **Level.** The level of the Weapon determines how many things it can store, and what stat bonuses it can grant.
 - A weapon can only store a limited number of things from past Wielders: 
    - **Skills** grant new abilitie and talents, and often give advantage on some rolls. 
    - **Spells** always work once, then the Wielder must make a successful INT save or lose the spell for the rest of the day. 
    - **Goals** are the unfinished business of past Wielders. Accomplishing these goals grants the Weapon more levels.

## Wielders are fragile but contain useful memories.

 - **Stat Bonuses.** The character sheet explains what each Stat is used for; simply add that number to the d20 roll.
 - **Inventory.** Wielders come with a few items already in their inventory, and may even use other weapons in addition to their Tempered Weapon.
 - **Appearance/Personality.** Some optional details to help players portray their Wielders.
 - **Spells.** Spells are written in books. Each spellbook takes up an inventory slot. 
 - **Skills.** Skills are known to the Wielder, and don't take up inventory slots.
 - **Goal.** Each Wielder has a goal that they are trying to accomplish. Goals don't take up inventory slots.

## How to Play

The GM should buy a copy of Knave, read the rules, and make sure all the players understand the basics. Hand each player a [Blank Character Sheet](linkedhere).

Players can generate a Weapon using the [Tempered Weapon Generator](linkhere) on their phones, or grab one of the [Pre-Made Weapon Sheets](linkhere).

The GM describes the adventure to the players, and places their Weapons just past the starting point. A group of Wielders stumble by and pick up them up. A new legend begins.

## When a Wielder picks up a weapon...

1. Use the [Wielder Generator](linkhere) on your phone to create a Wielder. _or grab one of the [Pre-Made Wielder Sheets](linkhere)_
2. Copy down their details on the character sheet. _Make enough room in your slots to store your Tempered Weapon!_
3. You may increase three different stats by +1. Repeat for every additional level of your weapon.
4. Roll a number of d8s equal to Weapon level to determine the Wielders new max HP. If the result is lower than the max HP, increase max HP by +1.
5. Your Wielder now has access to all the skills, spells, and goals stored in your Weapon.

## When a Wielder dies...

You MAY replace any skill/spell/goal of the Weapon with a skill/spell/goal from the Wielder. You con only replace a spell with another spell, or a skill with another skill, or a goal with another goal. _Even though spells are written in books they can still be transferred and stored in the Weapon._

## Passage of Time

After a group dies it will probably be a while before more people come wandering by to pick up the Weapons. How long that takes can drastically affect the situation in the dungeon:

 - After **a few days** very little changes. Perishables left behind are still good.
 - After **a week or two** the perishables have spoiled, a few monsters have returned.
 - After **several months** the area has been re-populated, reset traps, repaired hazards, etc.
 - After **a year or two** most of the Weapons and valuables left behind to have been moved to another room/region.
 - After **decades** the monsters and traps have changed. Re-populate with new creatures and switch out some of the traps.
 - **Centuries, or longer**, basically a new area. This is the GM's opportunity to transition to a completely new adventure altogether. _"As aeons passed, your Weapons lay forgotten among the piles of treasure that travel between kingdoms and realities. Then, one day, you feel a new Wielder lift you from the dusty floor..."_ 

## Advancement and Goals

Wielders don't have levels or experience. However Weapons can increase their level, allowing them store more memories and grant more stat bonuses. They increase their level by accomplishing the goals of past wielders. You have a few ways to tweak this:

 - **Random goals.** This is what the generator uses by default; goals that come from the Wielder and range from the small (earn 100 gold) to the legendary (become immortal). Level two requires completing two goals. Level three requires completing three goals, etc. The GM should feel free to tweak or alter the provided goals.
 - **Simple goals.** Give all Wielders the simple goal of completing the adventure. Weapons level up when they complete it. _Defeat the wizard, recover the black pearl, rob the dragon, or whatever adventure you're running at the time. When they complete an adventure, they level up._
 - **No goals.** Use the gold-as-XP systems in other games, or just hand out levels whenever you think it seems right.

## Health and Hirelings

If one Wielder dies before the rest, that player just twiddles their thumbs waiting for another Wielder to come along and pick them up. That sucks. Here are a few ways to solve this issue:

 - **Hirelings.** The classic solution to deadly adventures. 8-10 characters go into a dungeon, and the players control the whole group with various mechanics and rules. When a Wielder dies, another one immediately picks up the weapon and things keep moving forward. 
 - **Health Pool.** For a more abstract solution you can combine the HP of all Wielders into a central pool. So instead of 4 characters with 5 HP each, the Group has a Health of 20. Whenever a character takes damage it comes from the shared pool, and when the pool depletes, the entire group dies at the same time, dropping their Weapons at the same time. Individual Wielders can still suffer injuries, penalties, diseases, curses, etc. But HP is treated more like group health where one when character suffers, the entire group must pick up the slack.
 - **Highlander.** When a Wielder dies, another Wielder picks up the fallen Weapon and now gains the benefits of TWO Tempered Weapons. Players work together to control this Wielder, taking turns when deciding actions, or just working out disagreements with dice rolls. Eventually only one Wielder will be left carrying around a bunch of Tempered Weapons...until they too perish.

## Recommended Adventures

 - [**Tomb of the Serpent Kings**](linkhere) and [**Tower of the Stargazer**](linkhere) are my two top picks for any group just starting out. Lots of valuable loot, deadly traps, etc.
