I'm "exploding" [200 Word entries](https://200wordrpg.github.io/) and releasing them with additional content, fancy layout, and commentaries from the original designers. Each explosion will be a page or two in length, released monthly. You will be charged per release, not per month. If I get sick or fall behind schedule it won't affect your wallet.

Patreons get early access for just **$2 a month**. They also get to vote on which entries will be exploded next, and watch livestreams of David struggling with InDesign.

The money raised goes directly into the challenge to purchases prizes, hire artists, and cover misc costs that might crop up.
