Horror adventure inspired by a nightmare I once had.

A Sci-Fi horror adventure for the [Dread system]({{site.url}}/david/extremely-interesting-role-playing-games#dread). Dread is perfect for running a horror/thriller game, and uses a Jenga tower instead of dice to keep the tension high! Players are stranded on a damaged ship with a broken AI, and must survive long enough to repair their vessel and try to escape with their lives.

 * Tomer Gurantz made some incredible [**audio recordings, maps, character sheets, and more stuff**](http://www.supernovembergames.com/tomes-of-tomes/2016/10/1/dread-only-the-food-and-aliens) to make this adventure run even better!
 * [Richard Allred](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110758153649579874722/posts) also made a handy [**Questionnaire**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kJHmPZ9hLOMVlYWmtWSV9BcUk/view) to help flesh out the characters.
